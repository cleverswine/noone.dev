I am a full stack senior software engineer with extensive experience in all aspects of enterprise-level software development. I have been a developer since 1998.

Most of my programming experience has been with C# on the .NET framework. In recent years, however, I have transitioned to working with [Go](http://golang.org/) and [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/).

## What I can do

I would consider my specialties to be:

* RESTful APIs
* Authentication and Authorization (oauth)
* General-purpose Services
* Systems Integration
* Microservices Infrastructures
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

I have worked extensively with the following technologies:

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
* [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
* [IdentityServer](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/release/)

Additionally, I have plenty of experience with frontend technologies such as:

* AngularJS (1.x)
* css, less, js, and html
* frontend tools such as yarn, npm, gulp, and bower
