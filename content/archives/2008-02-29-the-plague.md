I finally got the plague. It&#8217;s no surprise, since the shack-up had it earlier this week. When I say the plague, I mean that awful cold that everyone is getting. In my case, it&#8217;s fever and coughing. Anyway&#8230; that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to say about that.

Meanwhile, my home state of Texas, which is primarily Republican, seems to be shifting towards Obama. Now they know how us Democrats feel when we have no one decent to vote for. [Texas Republicans cross over to vote for Obama](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23394070/)
