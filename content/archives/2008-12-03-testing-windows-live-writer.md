I just installed [Windows Live Writer](http://get.live.com/writer/overview) as a tool to publish stories to my web site.&#160; It has some promising features, and works with WordPress (yay MS).

I also just installed DropBox because I&#8217;ve been meaning to find a way to create offsite copies of some of our important files.&#160; I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I hear good things about it.

Hmm, now that I&#8217;m about to publish, I&#8217;m wondering if it will handle WordPress tags&#8230; it did not.
