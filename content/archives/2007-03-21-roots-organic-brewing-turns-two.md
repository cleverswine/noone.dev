title: Roots Organic Brewing Turns Two

Tonight is the 2 year anniversary party for local organic brewer, [Roots](http://www.rootsorganicbrewing.com/index.htm). I can attest to their popularity, as restaurants all the way out in Gresham carry their beer on tap. I&#8217;ve been enjoying the fine products of Roots since they began 2 years ago. In the words of [Willie Week](http://www.wweek.com/wwire/?p=7410):

> &#8220;With more than three dozen breweries prospering in the city, itâ€™s hard to believe that Roots Organic Brewing has only been on the market for two years. The homespun brewery, which kicks out some of the cityâ€™s finest (and most natural) brews, has invaded bars, restaurants and stores throughout the city, becoming a favorite of local drinkers at an exponential rate.&#8221;
