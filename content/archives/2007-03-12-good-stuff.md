Congratulations to Tim and Beatrice. I&#8217;ll be an uncle soon!

Here are a couple of fun web sites:

  * <a href="http://www.100mb.nl/" target="_blank">where is my mind</a>  
    This is the coolest piece of ASCII art that I&#8217;ve ever seen. If you&#8217;re using Firefox, hit &#8220;ctrl -&#8221; a couple of times to shrink the text.
  * <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jvdkuyp/flash/see.htm" target="_blank">Icon War</a>  
    Entertaining depiction of what your desktop icons do when you&#8217;re not looking.
