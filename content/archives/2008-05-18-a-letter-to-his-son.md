title: A Letter to His Son

Seeing a web nerd speak from the heart, for the whole world to see, is not all that common. I was pleasantly surprised when I came across [this post](http://zenhabits.net/2008/05/a-letter-to-my-son-on-starting-out-in-life/) on [zenhabits](http://zenhabits.net/). The author has written a letter to his 3 year old son, giving him advice on being happy in life&#8217;s journey. Note all of the positive comments that follow the post. I wouldn&#8217;t suggest that web nerds make a habit of this, as it would cease to be special, but it&#8217;s a nice break from the mundane &#8220;how-to&#8221; articles.
