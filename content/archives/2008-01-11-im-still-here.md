_Update_
  
Sorry for the long delay between posts. I&#8217;ve been working hard on our wedding web site. It&#8217;s just about done, but not close enough to make public at this point.

_My Back_
  
My back is a lot better these days,

_Possible Web Site Update_
  
Something that I want to try out on this web site is the [Yahoo! Media Player](http://developer.yahoo.com/mediaplayer/). Apparently I can just add a bit of javascript to my site and all of the mp3 files that I link to will be playable with an embedded music player. We&#8217;ll see how well that works.
  
[update] I added it. [Check out the music page](http://cleverswine.net/?page_id=17). It&#8217;s pretty cool, but I&#8217;m not committed to it yet. I&#8217;m a tad uncomfortable with linking to external javascript. I&#8217;ll also want to make sure it doesn&#8217;t slow things down.

_2008 Goals_
  
I have two goals to accomplish before our wedding in August/September. First, I must lose a lot of weight. I really don&#8217;t want to be a fat groom. Second, I want to write a song to play at the reception. I&#8217;ve been messing around a bit more with my electronic keyboard, and I have some ideas.

That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got for today, folks.
