[<img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/120/310618402_6dd331c8be_t_d.jpg?w=840" alt="beer fest" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 3px; margin-right: 6px;" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/310618402/sizes/l/) We&#8217;re heading over to the [Spring Beer &#038; Wine Festival](http://www.springbeerfest.com/) this afternoon. I prefer the spring event because it&#8217;s indoors and much less crowded than the summer or winter ones. [Walking Man](http://www.walkingmanbrewing.com/) brewery has a couple of interestingly named beers at the fest: Streetwalker Malt Liquor and Big Black Homo. I may have to try them based on the names alone.
