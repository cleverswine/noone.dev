We are at Cannon Beach staying in a really nice motel/house &#8211; [The White Herron](http://www.thewavesmotel.com/contemporary.html). It&#8217;s cloudy and cool, but nice enough to enjoy ourselves. Today we&#8217;ll be marching over to Haystack Rock, Pig &#8216;n Pancake, Ecola Park, and Hug Point.
