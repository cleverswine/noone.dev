It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve written about music, so here I go. My latest purchase is the new [Morrissey](http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey) album, [Years of Refusal](http://www.itsmorrisseysworld.com/). I really like it. I would even say it&#8217;s one of his best solo albums to date. Sure, his voice has flattened out with age, but he makes up for it with his usual clever lyrics and well composed music from his band. This album is very rock n&#8217; roll and has some catchy tunes. On a related note, I was browsing through a Portland Monthly magazine yesterday and they had a column with local alternatives to national bands. Their suggestion for Morrissey fans was [M. Ward](http://www.last.fm/music/M.+Ward). I&#8217;m familiar with the name, but I&#8217;ve never given him a listen. I think I will.
