We&#8217;ve just returned from our trip to Texas, where we saw all of my family and visited Galveston, Kemah, and Houston. We had a good time, but it&#8217;s nice to be home in Oregon. The heat and humidity down there was a bit much. [On flickr, you will find many photos from the trip](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/sets/72157604692347740/).
