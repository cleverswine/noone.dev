We are officially engaged! I gave her the ring this evening, and then the things that happen when one proposes happened. Happiness ensues&#8230;

_The dreary days come and go
  
And then the dreary days come and go again
  
Life will never be gentle or kind
  
Nor will it be important or spectacular
  
There&#8217;s never ending turmoil in my mind
  
Trying to understand what I can&#8217;t
  
I try my best, but I&#8217;ll never win
  
So why do I suffer through it all
  
When I could live in eternal peace?
  
I&#8217;ll tell you why&#8230;
  
The days are less dreary when you are around
  
Life is spectacular when shared with you
  
And your presence brings clarity
  
To an otherwise cloudy thing that we call life
  
Look me in the eyes._
