It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve written anything here, but I can&#8217;t say that I have anything real interesting to write about&#8230;

It&#8217;s 98 degrees in Gresham right now.

My contracting job is almost up, and we banged out this web site in 6 weeks: [http://www.xrankcelebrity5.com/](http://www.xrankcelebrity5.com/playground/play.aspx). There&#8217;s a good chance that I will stay and work full time for this company (Avenue A | Razorfish).

Bren is having her wedding dress altered today, or something like that. I&#8217;m staying inside the air-conditioned house.

We just finished watching &#8220;[The Wire](http://www.hbo.com/thewire/)&#8221; seasons 1-4, and now we&#8217;re watching &#8220;[Dexter](http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do)&#8220;. The Wire was great, and so is Dexter so far.

I installed a [plugin](http://lifehacker.com/355061/stream-netflix-watch-now-movies-manage-queue-in-media-center-with-mynetflix) for Windows Media Center to watch Netflix Watch Now movies via the WMC interface. It&#8217;s nice.

The [Astros](http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/hou;_ylt=As_0UpMVISuK73_ak3NBJDIRvLYF) are awful. They will be playing the BoSox again today. The Kansas City Royals are doing as well as the &#8216;Stros.
