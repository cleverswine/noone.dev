What do random people talk about in Portland?

Part voyeur daydream, part sad commentary on life as we know it, [Overheard in PDX](http://overheardinpdx.blogspot.com/) is a never-ending stream of the strange things that come out of other peopleâ€™s mouths, submitted by people who were lucky(?) enough to hear them.

Example:

> At the main library downtown, waiting for a computer, a guy (mid-to-late 30&#8217;s) shamelessly (and embarassingly) attempting to flirt with an 18 year-old PSU freshman (who says her R&#8217;s like W&#8217;s):
> 
> He: Wow, that&#8217;s an amazing accent! Is it British?
> 
> She: Actually, it&#8217;s a speech impediment.
