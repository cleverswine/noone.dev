title: Ike Messes Things Up

My family in Texas recently sat through yet another hurricane. This time it was Ike, and it was a direct hit to Galveston and Houston. Luckily, my Houston (Katy) peeps went unscathed and those in Nederland/Port Neches had only minor damage to their houses. They were lucky because if the storm surge had been much higher, they would have had flood damage in addition to the wind damage.

On a related note, the streaking Astros were forced to play two &#8220;home&#8221; games against the Cubs just 90 miles from Chicago in Milwaukee. From what I hear, the Cubs fans that showed up were quite rude and obnoxious. The Astros fans, and players, were understandably angered over the whole ordeal. Given the amazing pitching from the Cubs, we wouldn&#8217;t have won anyway, but still it would have been good sportsmanship to treat a team in turmoil with a little respect. Most of the Astros players have families that were directly affected by the storm and they had to make a last minute flight to Milwaukee to play a home game in front of their rival&#8217;s fan base. Not to mention, they are now on the road for an entire week while Houston recovers without them. Oh well, it&#8217;s just baseball, I reckon.
