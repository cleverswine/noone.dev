It&#8217;s been a house-like weekend. We started the weekend by continuing our search for a house to buy. We have a couple on the radar, but nothing perfect yet. Today, we inadvertently started rearranging furniture in our house. We&#8217;ve made the living room look much larger and nicer. It was a bit exhausting and we had to cancel our plans to see the new Coen brothers movie. We may see the movie tomorrow afternoon. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got.
