I have a working tabbed (ajax) media widget. The tabs display media from Flickr, Netflix, and Last.fm. It looks crazy simple, but there&#8217;s actually a lot of processing and caching code going on. It&#8217;s about 250 lines of PHP, with some simple jQuery on the front end. (update) Now it&#8217;s in the side bar to the right.
