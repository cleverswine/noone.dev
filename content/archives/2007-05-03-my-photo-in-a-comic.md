I don&#8217;t know how popular &#8220;MPK Adventures&#8221; is, as I had never heard of it until now, but the writer used one of my flickr photos for a backdrop in one of his comic frames. I think that&#8217;s pretty cool. Below is my photo, and [here is the comic](http://www.murpheek.com/archive.asp?NewsID=113) (see bottom left frame).
