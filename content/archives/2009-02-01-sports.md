As it turns out, however, I have little interest in this year&#8217;s Superbowl. I&#8217;m rooting for the Cardinals because they are the underdog. I was also just made aware that 3 teams share the record for the most championships, and the Steelers are one of those. The Cowboys are another, so I&#8217;d hate to see the Steelers pull ahead in that statistic. Meanwhile, my focus has been on NBA basketball, which I just discovered a passion for about 6 months ago. The Trailblazers are my team of course, and it has been an exciting season so far. We&#8217;ve been to one game here in Portland (my first NBA game ever), and I can&#8217;t wait to go again. There&#8217;s also MLB baseball, which has always been my favorite sport, and really the only professional sport of interest. I hate to admit that after watching basketball, I&#8217;m not nearly as excited about the upcoming baseball season as I would normally be. Basketball is fast-paced and there&#8217;s a reasonable number of games per season. Contrary to my previous belief, basketball can be a thinking man&#8217;s game and the talent of individual players is apparent. Baseball is slow, the games are way to long, and there are way too many games in the season. I&#8217;m not saying that my interest in the NBA has surpassed the MLB&#8230; not yet. We&#8217;ll see how this baseball season works out.
