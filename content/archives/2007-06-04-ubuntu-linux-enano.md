I removed Windows Vista on my main desktop computer and installed Ubuntu Linux. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve used linux, and I see it has improved a bit. So far everything is working, and I have all the software I could ever need.

Also, I bought a mini computer to hook up to the LCD television. It&#8217;s by a comany called Enano. The entire computer is about the size of a CD drive. I have Windows Vista installed on it. It&#8217;s cool to watch streaming media from the internet in full screen mode because it&#8217;s just like watching T.V. I rejoined Netflix and plan to use their &#8220;Watch Now&#8221; feature.
