_The Old:_ an amazing cover of the Queen song &#8220;Stone Cold Crazy&#8221; by Metallica. This is, of course, when Metallica was still a metal band.

_The New:_ Lamb of God has caught my attention lately. You&#8217;ll mostly find younger punks (not the good kind) listening to this stuff, but I like it anyway.
