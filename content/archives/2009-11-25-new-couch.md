We got our new couch from JCPenney last weekend.  We weren&#8217;t expecting it until mid-December because we had custom fabric put on it.  We&#8217;re glad to have it for Thanksgiving because we&#8217;re having company over for food and games.  I think the red (berry) fabric was a good choice, as it adds some color to the room and it matches the chair we recently purchased.  The rug is new as well.
