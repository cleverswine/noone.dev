These are my favorite albums, in no particular order&#8230;

**<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tarja/My+Winter+Storm" target="_blank">My Winter Storm</a> by Tarja**

Tarja used to sing with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nightwish" target="_blank">Nightwish</a>, but has recently gone solo.  She has one of the greatest female voices that I&#8217;ve ever heard.

**<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bella+Morte/Beautiful+Death" target="_blank">Beautiful Death</a> by Bella Morte**

This is still one of the best albums I&#8217;ve heard in the past 10 years or so.

**<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Chemical+Romance/Danger+Days%3A+The+True+Lives+of+the+Fabulous+Killjoys" target="_blank">Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</a> by My Chemical Romace**

I was pleasantly surprised by this new album from MCR.  I didn&#8217;t think it would be possible to live up to _The Black Parade_, but they did.

**<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Palast+Orchester+mit+Max+Raabe/Kein+Schwein+Ruft+Mich+An" target="_blank">Kein Schwein Ruft Mich An</a> by Palast Orchester mit Max Raabe**

This is some great 20s/30s era German music.  It&#8217;s very upbeat and probably humorous (I don&#8217;t understand German).

**<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Faith+No+More/King+for+a+Day%2C+Fool+for+a+Lifetime" target="_self">King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime</a> by Faith No More**

This is one of the most underrated, overlooked albums of the 90s.  This is Faith No More at their best, in my opinion.

**<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ego+Likeness/The+Order+of+the+Reptile" target="_blank">The Order of the Reptile</a> by Ego Likeness**

I saw Ego Likeness when they opened up for <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cr%C3%BCxshadows" target="_blank">The Cruxshadows</a>.  It&#8217;s some good, hard-hitting electronic/industrial/dance music.
