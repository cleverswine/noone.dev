After a few weeks of shopping in and around Portland, we finally landed some nice office furniture at a reasonable price.  <a title="City Liquidators" href="http://cityliquidators.com/" target="_blank">City Liquidators</a> turns out to be the place for furniture (and other things ranging from tampons to sofas).  Next up, we&#8217;ll be painting the room.
