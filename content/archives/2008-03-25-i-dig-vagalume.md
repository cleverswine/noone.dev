I&#8217;ve been using [Vagalume](http://vagalume.igalia.com/), a [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/dolcex/) player, on my internet tablet. This might be one of the best and most useful pieces of software that I&#8217;ve ever used. I particularly like the neighborhood radio feature, which plays songs from last.fm users that have similar tastes to mine. It&#8217;s like having a portable radio that only plays stuff that I like.
