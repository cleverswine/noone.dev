title: Problem with IE6?

It seems that people using Internet Explorer version 6.0 are missing some of the content on my web site. The left and right columns do not appear. There are 2 options to fix this problem:

  1. I can hack the WordPress theme stylesheets
  2. IE6 users can upgrade their web browser

Since option 1 isn&#8217;t really an option, here are links to the latest and greatest web browsers (they are free, so you should get one):
  
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/), [Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/)

Thank you.

p.s. While I&#8217;m writing about the web site, I want to mention that you can subscribe to my [RSS feed](http://cleverswine.net/?feed=rss2). I find [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) to be a good feed reader, but there are plenty of others to choose from.
