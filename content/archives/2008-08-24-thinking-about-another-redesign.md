title: Thinking About Another Redesign

I&#8217;ve been pretty happy with the current state of cleverswine.net, but I think it&#8217;s time for a redesign. I would like to de-emphasize the blogging portion of the site and instead create something more like a portal. I use quite a few web sites that provide activity feeds ([Facebook](http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php), [Delicious](http://delicious.com/dolcex), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3JHXWI5OX7HGS), [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/), [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/dolcex), and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/) to name a few). Since I rarely blog anything of interest, I&#8217;m thinking that the main content on cleverswine.net should be a summary of my online activity (a la [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/cleverswine)). That way, it&#8217;s constantly being updated and it gives more insight into me than my shallow blog entries. To take it even further, I&#8217;d like to be able to annotate my activity (I may be able to utilize FriendFeed for that). I still want to have a traditional blog, it just wouldn&#8217;t be the main focus.

Some other things I&#8217;d like to incorporate:
  
*An image gallery, rather than just linking to Flickr.
  
*A better &#8220;Project&#8221; page, where I can more easily showcase code and projects.
  
*A better &#8220;Music&#8221; page, where I can post songs with annotations.
  
*Be able to tag different elements on the site (not just blogs) and have a nice tag cloud.

So many ideas&#8230; None of this will happen in the near future, as I have enough on plate at the moment, but I will be doing some research on the matter. I&#8217;d like to stick with WordPress, and I think that will work out.
