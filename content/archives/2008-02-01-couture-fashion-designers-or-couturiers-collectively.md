I sort of learned a new word today: [couture](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/couture). As I was browsing the news, I came across a J.Lo article which warranted my attention (because J.Lo is&#8230; super cool). The title of the article is &#8220;[Even J.Loâ€™s hospital gowns have to be couture](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22940662/).&#8221; I had no idea what that meant, so I looked up _couture_ on dictionary.com. I still don&#8217;t know what it means. Perhaps she needs designer gowns in the hospital??? Anyway, I bet my genius fiance can explain it to me when I see her this evening.
