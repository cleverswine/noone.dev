<del datetime="2011-03-18T00:50:48+00:00">Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on</del> <a title="Test Site" href="http://cleverswine.net/" target="_blank">What I worked on</a>.  Right now it&#8217;s just a basic display of feeds from some of my social networks.  I&#8217;d like to fancy it up a bit at some point, perhaps with some nice jQuery tooltips.  I&#8217;m using the SimplePie PHP library to fetch the feeds (each one asynchronously).  The design is borrowed from <a title="Popurls" href="http://popurls.com/" target="_blank">Popurls</a>.  I know it&#8217;s not that interesting, but it&#8217;s fun for me.
