On Friday, Bren wondered into the New Seasons Market in Happy Valley to find the brewer from [Ninkasi](http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/) giving a talk and presentation. She was kind enough to purchase my 3 favorite Ninkasi varieties. Ninkasi is based in Eugene, so I think it&#8217;s cool that he came to make an appearance in Happy Valley for the beer-loving Portland area.
