I have 2 fairly new toys that are exciting enough (to me) to write about. One is a 37&#8243; LCD television from Olevia. I got a great deal on it, and we are very happy with it. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have HD service yet. Soon. The other toy is a mouse for my PDA. The mouse itself isn&#8217;t that impressive, but it gives my PDA a laptop feel. I&#8217;m currently running Linux with ICEWM as the window manager. It is fully loaded with a variety of Linux aplications.
