I thought I would be able to make it through _Mamma Mia_, given that I&#8217;m a big fan of Abba music. On the contrary, those were some of the worst 2.5 hours that I&#8217;ve experienced. The music was fine, but the play itself was boring and intolerable. I had leave at one point because I was squirming out of my uncomfortable chair. Unless you&#8217;re a musical junkie, don&#8217;t see this. Bren was able to tolerate it, but then she is a musical junkie.
