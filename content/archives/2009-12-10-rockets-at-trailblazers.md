[<img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-right: 6px;" title="At the game" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2723/4174408711_b4d135b243_t.jpg?resize=75%2C100" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/4174408711/)On December 5th, we attended the Houston Rockets @ Portland Trailblazers game.  We sat way up in the 300 section, but we had mid-court aisle seats which turned out to be quite nice.  Portland won the game &#8211; and they have won all 3 games we&#8217;ve been to (against tough opponents).  I think we bring good luck&#8230; for wins.  Unfortunately, we were witness to the season ending injury of Greg Oden.  It was bad.  The entire arena went silent.  The Rockets showed class by giving him a pat on the back and some nice words before they wheeled him out on the stretcher.  The city of Portland is saddened by this, as we have all come to really like Greg as a player and a person.
