I joined [Weight Watchers Online](http://www.weightwatchers.com/)<font style="position: absolute;overflow: hidden;height: 0;width: 0"><a href="http://www.videnov.com/">&#1084;&#1077;&#1073;&#1077;&#1083;&#1080; &#1087;&#1083;&#1086;&#1074;&#1076;&#1080;&#1074;</a></font> today. I had success with them about 5 years ago when I got skinny and stayed that way until I met my wife. Something about being married makes one forget to be healthy. I had actually written [my own Weight Watchers type web application](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/480594956/sizes/o/in/set-72157600412400417/) a couple of years ago, but I didn&#8217;t use it well. Now that I&#8217;m paying $17 a month, I think I&#8217;ll stick to the plan. It is day one, so I&#8217;ve got a ways to go. I haven&#8217;t used the WW site long enough to give an analysis, but as a software developer I will be viewing it with a critical eye. At some point I&#8217;ll write some sort f review of my experience with their online tools.
