I&#8217;ve always wanted to go with a dark theme for my web site, but, as I&#8217;ve said before, I&#8217;m not a designer. Well, I happened upon a [giant list of themes](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/02/09/83-beautiful-wordpress-themes-you-probably-havent-seen/) that I could use, and so I chose one. What do you think? I personally like it better than the last one.
