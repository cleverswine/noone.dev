I&#8217;m becoming an expert with Process Server (cough cough). It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been in a training class that really challenges me. As an old school procedural programmer, it&#8217;s a bit mind-blowing to design processes visually. I&#8217;m a proponent of simple, straight-forward software design &#8211; which Process Server is not. I&#8217;m not knocking Process Server, it&#8217;s actually quite a cool tool. I can foresee hours of fun with it, once I understand it. I am aging prematurely&#8230;
