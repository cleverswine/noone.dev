title: CardDAV &#8211; WebDAV for vCard

While reading my daily dose of the [Data Portability](http://dataportability.org/) mailing list, I uncovered an interesting idea that could solve a problem that I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a long time. That problem would be the inability to share personal address books (PAB) across multiple computers. The project is called [CardDAV](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-carddav-03). Think of it as IMAP for email, or WebDAV for files. So far, it&#8217;s just an idea. I certainly hope the idea becomes a specification and is adopted by the major address book applications.
