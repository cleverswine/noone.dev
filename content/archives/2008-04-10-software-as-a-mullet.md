title: Software As a Mullet

While considering the fun of programming today, I came up with a new mantra: “Software development should be like a mullet &#8211; business in the front, party in the back.”

Today&#8217;s biggest buzzword in the industry is “software as a service”. I propose that we toss that idea, and instead standardize on “software as a mullet”. The new approach will focus on having fun during the software lifecycle, while producing business approved results. This will be followed by books such as:
