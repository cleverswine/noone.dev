So, now that I have a super cool, tiny, quiet computer that is always on (because it holds all of my documents and multimedia for the other computers on my network), I feel like it should be doing something. It serves up files for my other computers, but it still sits there idle 99% of the time. I thought about having it download illegal media with bit torrent, but that can lead to headaches (viruses, etc). I could also set it up as a web server, but I can&#8217;t think of a good reason to do that. I attached a TV tuner to it, but quickly ran out of ideas to make that cool. The picture isn&#8217;t good enough to use it as a media center, and we have DirecTV which means the tuner can&#8217;t control channel switching, etc. Anyway&#8230; I had nothing else to write about, so there you go.
