title: I Put Stickers on My Car

I decided that my car is old enough to put stickers on it. I&#8217;ve had a pile of Morrissey and Smiths stickers in storage for years (like, about 10-15 years). I put a couple of the Smiths ones on my rear window, along with an Astros sticker that I just purchased. I&#8217;ll probably leave it at that because it looks tastefully done. I saw a great bumper sticker yesterday, which read &#8220;Bumper Sticker&#8221;.
