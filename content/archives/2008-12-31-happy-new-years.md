2009 is upon us. We as a country have a lot of improvements to make this year. I, as an individual, don&#8217;t have a lot of change in mind. My only big resolution is to lose some weight and get back into shape. I&#8217;ve let myself go since meeting Bren. I feel bad for her, because she thought she was getting involved with a lean, mean, programming machine. Now, I&#8217;m an unemployed fat slob (okay, that may be an exaggeration). Anyway, happy New Years and good luck in 2009. I&#8217;ll be eating my black-eyed peas and cabbage for sure this year!
