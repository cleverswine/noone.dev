I&#8217;ve decided that I want a [nutria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutria) for a pet (or nutra-rat, as it&#8217;s called in Texas and Louisiana). I didn&#8217;t think we had nutria up here in Oregon, but I was wrong. Apparently there&#8217;s a [&#8220;nutria pond&#8221; in Gresham](http://www.theoutlookonline.com/sustainable/story.php?story_id=120494872914082400), on the Springwater Trail. Unfortunately, for the nutria, people are being encouraged not to feed them and to have them captured and killed. I guess they are quite the nuisance, digging holes and eating up vegetation and kicking out native animals. They are awfully cute, though.
