The Portland Ikea finally opened last week. We went and we shopped, but not on opening day. We actually didn&#8217;t buy all that much. I got a new desk chair that is very mod looking. The couch that we&#8217;ve been wanting for months has been disconinued and they had nothing else close enough to it. That was quite disappointing. For now we&#8217;re stuck with my $80 Goodwill couch from the 70s.
