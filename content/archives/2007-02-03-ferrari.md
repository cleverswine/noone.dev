I sold my 17&#8243; widescreen laptop because it was too large and heavy to carry around. After much research, I bought the Acer Ferrari ultraportable 12.1&#8243; laptop as a replacement. It weighs in at 3.5 lbs. I&#8217;ve got Windows Vista running on it, and so far it has been worth the high price tag.
