<img id="image30" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.cleverswine.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/tooth.jpg?resize=18%2C20" alt="tooth" align="left" style="margin-right: 4px;" data-recalc-dims="1" />I had my teeth cleaned today, for the first time in&#8230; a while. I stand by my theory that the number of visits to the dentist is proportional to the number of tooth problems one has (the theory is not unfounded). I&#8217;m thinking once every 18 months is often enough for cleaning.
