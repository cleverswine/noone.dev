[This is an funny article](http://www.codethinked.com/post/2007/12/The-Programmer-Dress-Code.aspx) about how most visionaries in the programming world have beards and dress like slobs. I have to say, dressing nice and shaving are at the bottom of my list of priorities. I think the same could be said for most of the programmers that I know.
