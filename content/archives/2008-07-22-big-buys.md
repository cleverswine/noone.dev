I&#8217;ve got a couple of expensive items in my mental shopping cart.

My car is 8+ years old now, so I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s time for a new one. Since Bren has an SUV, I&#8217;m thinking small. Mini, in fact. Among the list of potential cars, the [MINI Cooper S](http://www.miniusa.com/) is currently at the top of the list. Also on the list is the Toyota Prius, Audi TT, and BMW 135i. The Audi and BMW are probably out because I can&#8217;t stand the thought of spending that much on an automobile.

The other thing is a new, larger TV. [This one](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LN52A550-52-Inch-1080p-HDTV/dp/B001415EMI/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&#038;coliid=I3D9516UX7EEN4&#038;colid=3JHXWI5OX7HGS) seems like a good deal. I&#8217;ve got to do a bit more research, but I think this is quite a good price for a 52&#8243; LCD television.
