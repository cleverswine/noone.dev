This summer is getting off to a slow start, as are our vegetables. We planted tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, various peppers, and carrots. So far we haven&#8217;t picked a thing. We&#8217;ve barely reached the 80s in temperature, and we&#8217;ve had more rain than usual. However, despite the lack of veggies, I&#8217;m personally enjoying the cool summer.
