[Caring for Your Introvert](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200303/rauch?r)

This is an interesting article about introverts and how to deal with them. I wonder why I&#8217;d post about such a subject? My favorite part is:

> **How can I let the introvert in my life know that I support him and respect his choice?**
> 
> First, recognize that it&#8217;s not a choice. It&#8217;s not a lifestyle. It&#8217;s an orientation.
> 
> Second, when you see an introvert lost in thought, don&#8217;t say &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; or &#8220;Are you all right?&#8221;
> 
> Third, don&#8217;t say anything else, either.
