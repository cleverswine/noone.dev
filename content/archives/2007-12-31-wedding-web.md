Now that I&#8217;m engaged, the obvious next step is to build a web site for the wedding. So far, I&#8217;m looking at four choices.

  * [Brides.com](http://www.brides.com/) has a free web site builder. The template looks really nice, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be real flexible.
  * [TheKnot.com](http://weddings.theknot.com/pwp/pwp_offers.aspx) also has a free web site builder. It seems a little basic and inflexible.
  * I could create my own, with a subdomain like wedding.cleverswine.net. I would hate to reinvent the wheel, though. I could use WordPress or something to have a starter shell.
  * The fourth option is &#8220;none of the above,&#8221; which means I&#8217;d use something I haven&#8217;t discovered yet.

I wouldn&#8217;t expect to see anything for a couple of months. Suggestions are welcome. Note that you have to register and log in to add comments to my posts. I was getting some spam comments, so I had to lock it down.
