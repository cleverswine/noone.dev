A friend just told me about [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/), which is sort of a social web aggregater. Rather than try to explain it, here&#8217;s what they say about themselves:

> Our goal is to make content on the Web more useful and discoverable by taking advantage of your social connections. FriendFeed is a simple tool that scratches the surface of that goal by making it easier to keep track of the web pages, videos, music, and photos your friends and family interact with around the Internet.

Now, to see what I am doing, check out [my FriendFeed page](http://friendfeed.com/cleverswine), or subscribe to it&#8217;s feed. If you use any of the common &#8220;social&#8221; sites like delicious, Flickr, Netflix, Twitter, Last.fm, etc, then please set up your own feed to share with me. Fun fun.
