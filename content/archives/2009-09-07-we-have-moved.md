We moved in to our new house Friday. I don&#8217;t have many photos yet because we are still unpacking. So far, almost everything has gone well. DirecTV is unwilling to get on our roof to install the satellite dish. Apparently, it is unsafe. We&#8217;ve asked for a second opinion from another installer, so we&#8217;ll see. Other than that, all is good!

[Some photos are here, with more to come as we get settled in.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/sets/72157622133799217/)

Also, today is our one year anniversary! Congrats to us.
