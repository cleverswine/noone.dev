Naturally, our initial reaction was one of terror. We slouched down on the couch to hide from the little singing monsters. Then, the doorbell rang. We, of course, did not answer it. After about an hour, when we knew that the monsters were gone, we opened the front door. On the doorstep, we found a Mormon DVD about Jesus Christ. It was a gaggle of Mormon children that came to terrify us with their Christmas Carols. The horror! The DVD went in the trash. We went back to the couch to enjoy the rest of the evening.
