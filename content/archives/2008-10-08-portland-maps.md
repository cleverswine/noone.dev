I&#8217;ve lived here long enough to be pretty familiar with all of Portland metro, but sometimes hard numbers add a little something. [PortlandMaps.com](http://www.portlandmaps.com/) has a decent tool for showing an overview, and details, of crime in Portland. The darker the red, the more crime there was in the past 12 months. I have to say, I&#8217;ve lived in some of the dark red areas (inner SE) and always felt safe. Still, it&#8217;s a nice overview.
