Bren has canning fever. It all started with a canning book that she received as a Christmas present. Now, she has canned (or jarred as I like to call it) Salsa, Pasta Sauce, Blueberry Jam, and Sweet Pickles. The nice thing is that we&#8217;ll be well stocked with food that we know is locally grown and chemical free.
