This morning I was browsing [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=97080) because there are lots of neat weather related features on that site (almanacs, astrology, maps galore, etc). I was looking through the various Portland weather stations and came across one called &#8220;[Felony Flats, Portland, OR](http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXDailyHistory.asp?ID=KORPORTL76)&#8220;. I thought that was pretty funny. What&#8217;s funnier is the link to the station&#8217;s web site: [Coffin Cruisers Hearse Club of Portland](http://www.coffincruisers.com/). I had no idea there existed a community of people who drive hearses (and have personal weather stations).
