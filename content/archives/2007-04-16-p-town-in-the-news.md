I cam across this article on the OregonLive.com website: [Portland in 36 hours: Story on City of Roses hits heights on NYTimes.com](http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2007/04/portland_in_36_hours_travel_pi.html). After a bit of browsing around, I found some more interesting write-ups on this fine town of ours. See links below&#8230;

From the New York Times:
  
[36 Hours in Portland, Ore.](http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/travel/15hours.html?em&#038;ex=1176696000&#038;en=bd2119c7a945840c&#038;ei=5087%0A) 
  
[In Oregon, It&#8217;s a Brew Pub World](http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/01/13/travel/escapes/13beer.html?fta=y)
  
[In Portland, Ore., Where Trees and Imagination Are Evergreen](http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/travel/escapes/16KIDS.html?fta=y)

Food Network:
  
[Delicious Destination of the Year](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_aw/text/0,3151,FOOD_28456_61089,00.html) (this one is suprising to me)
