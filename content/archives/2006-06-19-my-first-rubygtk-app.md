title: My first Ruby/GTK app

In experimenting with the [GTK](http://www.gtk.org/) widget set (an open source, cross platform user interface library), I&#8217;ve produced this little application to search Amazon.com for movie titles. The movies can be saved locally and be printed to make DVD covers, etc. It&#8217;s not finished yet. Ruby is the language I&#8217;ve chosen for this development.
