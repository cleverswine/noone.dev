I&#8217;ve just discovered a [hot sauce](http://wheelhousepickles.com/shop/threat) named after one of my favorite 80s straight edge punk bands, [Minor Threat](http://dischord.com/band/minorthreat). [Pitchfork says it&#8217;s so.](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/47674-minor-threat-turns-condiment-but-ian-doesnt-mind) It sounds delicious!

> Made from a rare, mild breed of habaneros grown specifically for us, Minor Threat draws its inspiration from the legendary West Indies&#8217; mustard- and mango-based habanero sauces, only it mysteriously priviledges the pepper&#8217;s fruitiness over its notoriously overwhelming heat.
