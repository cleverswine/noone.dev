<a href="http://www.weezer.com/discography/?AssetID=1269241" target="_blank" title="I look just like Buddy Holly"><img src="/kn-images/bh.jpg" alt="Buddy Holly" border="0" align="left" style="margin-right: 4px;" /></a>I went to the optometrist today and ordered new glasses, similar to the ones pictured here (but not quite as extreme). My eyes were proclaimed healthy and they have only slightly degraded over the past 4 years (the last time I saw the optometrist).
