Hmmm, the [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) is all over the &#8220;blogosphere&#8221; today. I first read about Google&#8217;s new service yesterday, so I promptly signed up to be a beta tester. Today, I was invited to join 10,0000 other programmers to give the App Engine a trial run.

The App Engine is being greeted with mixed feelings by the developer community. Personally, after reading the documentation and API, I can&#8217;t think of a good reason to use it. It has some benefits over other application hosting options, but it sacrifices flexibility in return.

[Search Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=google+app+engine) for plenty of buzz.
