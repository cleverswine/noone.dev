title: New Rails Project (with Ext JS)
url: /2007/04/09/ext-web-20-test-project/
---

I&#8217;ve been working on a new Ruby on Rails project for the past week. What I&#8217;m aiming for is a well organized, simple, easy to use code snippet library. There are plenty of community code snippet sites out there, but I found that I needed my own personal collection of code since I know what I&#8217;m likely to need. When I first started this project, I heard about [Ext JS](http://extjs.com/), which is a toolkit for Ajax and UI components. It&#8217;s basically a wrapper around [Yahoo UI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/), [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/), and [prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/). I decided to learn more about Ext by using it with my Rails application. So far I&#8217;m quite impressed. The documentation is way lacking, but if you&#8217;re familiar with Javascript. Html, and some Ajax, then it&#8217;s not that difficult to figure out. In a matter of hours, I&#8217;ve managed to throw together the following rich interface &#8211; fully functional. The tree on the left supports in-place [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD_(acronym)) and drag/drop. (click screenshot to see more detail)
