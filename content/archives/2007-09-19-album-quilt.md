If you look at my [Music page](http://cleverswine.net/?page_id=17), you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;ve added an &#8220;album quilt&#8221; from my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/dolcex/) account. It shows a collage of all the albums that I listen to most frequently. I think this is way cool, but you may not. If you&#8217;re not familiar with last.fm, here&#8217;s how it works: any time I listen to music, the song information is transmitted to my last.fm account. This way, I can get music recommendations based on what I listen to, I can have my own web radio station, I can show people what I listen to, etc. That&#8217;s where the album listing on the right side of the page comes from.

Also, I enhanced my [Morrissey page](http://cleverswine.net/?page_id=126) with an album quilt and public photos from Flickr tagged with Morrissey.
