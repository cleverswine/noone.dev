Weather is generally a boring topic, but 2008 has proven to be much less than boring. Northwest Oregon has seen late snow, followed by the expected sunny and warm days. Now, the snow is returning! [Forecasts](http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2008/04/wintry_weekend_on_tap_on_the_h.html) predict that the snow level will lower to 500 feet again this weekend. What&#8217;s going on? I bet Al Gore is confused&#8230;
