We did some bedroom rearranging and I created a masculine corner for myself. I included part of my Van Gogh collection, my retro gold chair (or &#8220;baby puke green&#8221;, as some would say), my Ikea dresser (inherited from an ex of an ex), and my Ikea nightstand. It&#8217;s very simple and &#8220;in place&#8221;. The other corner is girly, but nice.
