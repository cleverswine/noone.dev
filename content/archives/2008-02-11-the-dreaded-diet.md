I&#8217;ve been on a diet since January 1st of this year. So far I&#8217;ve gained 1.5 pounds (as seen in the graph above). It&#8217;s time for a new approach. I&#8217;m thinking that a tad bit of exercise might help, but then who has the time or motivation for that? Not I. I will just have to eat less and quit snacking. I wrote a cool Rails app and everything to track my weight loss (which has become weight gain). My new approach starts today.
