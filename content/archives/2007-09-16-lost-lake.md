We spent the weekend camping at Lost Lake. First, we stopped by the Bonneville Dam Fish Hatchery to check out some giant sturgeon. Then, we got lost on the way to Lost Lake. We were on a gravel road somewhere on the mountain for almost two hours. We finally re-found civilization and made our way to the campground. The weather was decent, but chilly and cloudy. We did some hiking and stuff. Sunday morning greeted us with rain, so we packed up and headed home.

Here are the photos (click image):
