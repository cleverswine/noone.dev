Today, I&#8217;ve come across a handful of websites which are exciting enough to me that they should be shared (with all 2 people that read my web site&#8230;).

[Woody Allen&#8217;s typography](http://kitblog.com/2007/12/woody_allens_typography.html)
  
An article about another one of my favorite people, combined with the nerdiness of font analysis. It had never occurred to me that Woody uses the same font, Windsor-EF Elongated, for all of his film titles.

[30 Things to Do to Keep From Getting Bored Out of Your Skull at Work](http://zenhabits.net/2008/01/30-things-to-do-to-keep-from-getting-bored-out-of-your-skull-at-work/)
  
Not that I would ever admit to being bored at work, but if by some miraculous miracle I did become bored, this could be a handy list of things to keep myself occupied.

[Star Trek reboot to blast off this year](http://forevergeek.com/movies/star_trek_reboot_to_blast_off_this_year.php)
  
If there’s one movie that has the geeks all excited, it’s the Star Trek re-boot being helmed by JJ Abrams.

[Texas town forever twinned with Columbia](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22934998/)
  
Ah, good ol&#8217; Nacogdoches. It&#8217;s not far from my hometown. One of my best friends, Kory B., got married settled down there. The bachelor party was interesting&#8230; think confederate flags, beer, and Willie Nelson.

[The Smiths File Online](http://www.plunderingdesire.com/)
  
A new web site about the greatest band ever! The Smiths File Online is a thorough summary of the extensive coverage the band received in the music press from 1983-1987.
