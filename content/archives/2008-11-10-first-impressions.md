I&#8217;m at the Chicago office this week, helping out on a .Net web project. I haven&#8217;t seen much of the city yet, but my first impression is that it&#8217;s big and old (old != bad). I&#8217;m staying about .75 miles from the office, so I might walk back to the hotel this evening and check things out on the way. I probably won&#8217;t get out much while I&#8217;m here, but if I do, I&#8217;ll be sure to take photos.
