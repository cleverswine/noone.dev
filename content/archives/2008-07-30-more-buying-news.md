I&#8217;ve put my big buys on hold for now. I can&#8217;t decide what kind of car I want. I test drove the MINI Cooper and did not like it. It was too small, too noisy, and although the interior was pretty fancy, it felt cheap. As for the BMW and Audi, I can&#8217;t see spending $40k on a car when I can get one that works just as well for $20k. Needless to say, I have a lot of research left to do before I buy anything. The Honda Fit is now on my list.

Speaking of buying things, I just read about a new Dell mini PC ([Dell Studio Hybrid](http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/desktop-studio-hybrid?c=us&#038;cs=19&#038;l=en&#038;s=dhs&#038;ref=dthp)), which would be great as a nice looking media PC connected to a television. It starts at $499, but by the time I added what I deemed to be necessary options, it was $1600. Anyway, I&#8217;ve already got a good media PC, but I&#8217;m always prepared to upgrade.
