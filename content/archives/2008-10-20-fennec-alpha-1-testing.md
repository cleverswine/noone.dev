I installed the mobile version of Firefox, named [Fennec](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/fennec/1.0a1/releasenotes/), on my Nokia n800 today. It&#8217;s intolerably slow (but it&#8217;s alpha, so that can be ignored for now), but has some potentially cool features like tabbed browsing and a &#8220;smart&#8221; URL bar.
