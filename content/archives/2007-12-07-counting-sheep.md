I&#8217;ve always wondered where the term &#8220;counting sheep&#8221; came from. I&#8217;ve tried counting sheep to fall asleep, and it doesn&#8217;t work. In my case, the sheep don&#8217;t cooperate. Come to find out&#8230;

> &#8230;counting sheep is actually an inferior means of inducing sleep. Subjects who instead imagined &#8220;a beach or a waterfall&#8221; were forced to expend more mental energy, and fell asleep faster than those asked to simply count sheep.
