According to the [Programmer Personality Test](http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11), my programmer personality type is DHSC:

_You&#8217;re a **D**oer._
  
You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.

_You like coding at a **H**igh level._
  
The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.

_You work best in a **S**olo situation._
  
The best way to program is by yourself. There&#8217;s no communication problems, you know every part of the code allowing you to write the best programs possible.

_You are a **C**onservative programmer._
  
The less code you write, the less chance there is of it containing a bug. You write short and to the point code that gets the job done efficiently.
