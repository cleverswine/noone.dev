[The Bachelor Guy](http://www.thebachelorguy.com/?itemid=390) has put together a list called &#8220;[The Dream Case &#8211; 24 Great American Craft Beers You Should Be Drinking](http://www.thebachelorguy.com/?itemid=390)&#8220;. I&#8217;ve tried about half of the beers on the list, and they are all good. Unfortunately, it appears that the list makers have never been to Portland, and there are some better brews missing from the list (Bridgeport, Deschutes, Laurelwood, Roots, etc). The best part of the list is the reader comments (&#8220;what ever. come to Portland.&#8221;).
