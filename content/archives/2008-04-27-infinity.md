I&#8217;ve been reading [The Infinite Book: A Short Guide to the Boundless, Timeless and Endless](http://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Book-Boundless-Timeless-Endless/dp/1400032245/), which so far is a history of theories on infinity. Infinity is something that I&#8217;ve always been interested in, but I had never read theories predating Hawking. I came across an article on the web today called [A Brain Cell is the Same as the Universe](http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/pc/brain-universe.html). I&#8217;m afraid a brain cell is _not_ like the universe. The _universe_ is another name for infinite space and time. The web site claims that the universe is billions of light years across, which doesn&#8217;t make sense to me. Since when is the universe a finite structure? I just don&#8217;t see the comparison.
