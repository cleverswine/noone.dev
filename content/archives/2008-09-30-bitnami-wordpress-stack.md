I&#8217;ve just installed the [BitNami WordPress Stack](http://bitnami.org/stack/wordpress) on my laptop and it was so easy, and so cool! After the install, I had a fully functioning WordPress up and running locally &#8211; complete with Apache, MySql, and PHP. After installation, I exported all of the data from cleverswine.net and imported it locally &#8211; again, super easy. As a result, I have a copy of my web site running locally that I can play around with. Sure, I could have installed Linux and set up everything that way, but I&#8217;ve had a hell of a time getting Linux to work on my laptop (I tried bleeding edge Ubuntu, Fedora, and Mint). Anyway, I happen to be very pleased with Vista.
