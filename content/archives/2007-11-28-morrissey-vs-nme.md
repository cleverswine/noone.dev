In the newest issue of NME (a British magazine about new music), there is a cover story on [Morrissey](http://cleverswine.net/?page_id=126). Morrissey and NME have always been at odds, but it has generally been tame. This time, however, rather than just publishing the Morrissey interview as it was done, NME decided to add commentary that totally trashes the man. I&#8217;ve not read the article, titled &#8220;Has the World Changed, or Has He Changed?&#8221;, as it&#8217;s not readily available to me.
