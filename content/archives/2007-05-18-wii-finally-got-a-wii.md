title: Wii Finally Got a Wii

After months of looking and waiting, Bren came across a [Nintendo Wii](http://www.wii.com/) yesterday! I guess Nintendo finally caught up with the demand. The last gaming console that I&#8217;ve owned was an [Intellivision II](http://www.intellivisionlives.com/), back in the 80s. I&#8217;ve been waiting for the right system to come along, as I&#8217;m not impressed (or good at) the modern genre of games. So far the Wii has not disappointed. We only have Wii Sports, which came bundled, but it will take a while to get tired of that. My favorite game so far is Tennis. The Wii will also help with my diet because it&#8217;s interactive.
