Dag Nasty was my favorite punk band. They had a mostly positive message and lots of energy. I&#8217;m not sure exactly what this song is about&#8230; values and confidence?
  
_&#8220;fear of failure; fear of reprimand; two big problems I&#8217;ve never had; I never doubted what I had inside&#8230; what I have inside&#8221;_
