[<img src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.cleverswine.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/dd2.jpg?resize=125%2C100" alt="" title="dd2" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-541" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://dobbschallenge2.com/) I&#8217;ve been subscribing to [Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Journal](http://www.ddj.com/) for at least 10 years. It has always been my favorite technical magazine because of it&#8217;s diversity of topics and brain-stirring articles. I got a letter in the mail last week saying that they were ceasing production of the full magazine. Instead, they will offer a Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Report stuffed into issues of InformationWeek. I&#8217;ll have to spend more time on their web site, as it looks like they have some good content on there.
