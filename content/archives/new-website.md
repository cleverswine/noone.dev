It's been almost 4 years since I last posted to a blog. I've been learning quite a bit over the past couple of years, so I thought I might give it another shot. 
Some of the things that I'd like to write about:

* Go (golang)
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Dotnet Core
* IdentityServer
* OAuth and OpenID Connect

Also, I'm ditching Wordpress in favor of a static site generator. Specifically, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). 
Hugo is a bit geared toward the developer-type, which suits me. It's even written in Go!
