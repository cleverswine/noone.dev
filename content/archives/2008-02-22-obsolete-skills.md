I&#8217;ve come to realize that I have **many** obsolete skills. Check out this gigantic list of skills considered to be obsolete: [Obsolete Skills](http://obsoleteskills.com/Skills/Skills). I must be old, because as I scan through the list, I keep saying &#8220;oh yeah, I&#8217;ve done that.&#8221; Here are some examples of how old I am&#8230; Rabbit ears. PASCAL. Dialing a rotary phone. Formatting a floppy. Putting a needle on a vinyl record. Rewinding VCR tapes. Rewinding an audio cassette using a Bic pen. Setting a baud rate, parity and stop-bits. AT commands for dial-up modems. Using a microfiche. Archie.
