I&#8217;ve been working on some code to display various pieces of my web life here on cleverswine.net. My first chosen task is to display my recently listened to album covers from Last.fm (like you see in the side bar to the right). I could have used the widget that I&#8217;m currently using, but my end goal is a little different (more on that later). Plus, I&#8217;m learning PHP, and it&#8217;s always fun to learn a new language.

[I uploaded my code to Snipplr in hopes of getting some feedback and/or criticism](http://snipplr.com/view/8810/get-album-covers-for-recent-tracks-from-lastfm/).
