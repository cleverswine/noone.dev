There are some amazing bridges in the world. Someone has posted a list of their 10 favorite bridges here: [10 Most Beautiful Bridges in the World](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/03/07/10-most-beautiful-bridges-in-the-world/)

I would have liked to have seen a [Portland bridge](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=portland%20oregon%20bridge&#038;w=all) in the list. Perhaps St. John&#8217;s Bridge.
