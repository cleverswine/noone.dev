title: Trying out Windows Live Writer

Scott Hanselman has been trumpeting Windows Live Writer for some time now.  I’ve been hesitant to try it out because I’m a control freak and I was convinced that Live Writer wouldn’t do things correctly.  Well, he <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DownloadWindowsLiveWriter2012.aspx" target="_blank">blogged about it again today</a> so I’m giving it a try (with this post).  It was the comments on his post that swayed me.

Live Writer has improved quite a bit since last time I tried it.  It actually pulled down my WordPress theme in order to provide a themed preview, which isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough to get an idea.  Adding categories and tags is really simple, with type-ahead suggestions from previous posts.  It looks like it has some powerful picture, video and map embedding tools, which I will try eventually.

The thing I’m most curious about is embedding code snippets.  It looks like all of the syntax highlighting plugins are 2+ years old.  Update: I tried a couple of them and they both resulted in an awful looking table.
