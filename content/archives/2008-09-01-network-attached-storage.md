I just bought a [Netgear RND2175 ReadyNAS Duo 750 GB Desktop Network Attached Storage](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSU80) from Amazon.com. I&#8217;ve been looking at these for a while, and finally decided on this one. The device holds 2 750gb drives which are mirrored for constant data redundancy. In addition, it runs an embedded version of Linux and can do pretty much anything a Linux computer can do. There&#8217;s an active [user and developer community](http://www.readynas.com/) for help with every aspect of the system, including extending it and customizing it. Very exciting stuff!
