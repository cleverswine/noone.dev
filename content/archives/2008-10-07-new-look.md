I found the [Aeros](http://thebuckmaker.com/aeros) wordpress theme, downloaded it, made some modifications, added my photos/movies/music widget, and here it is! I&#8217;ve only tested in Firefox 3 and Internet Explorer 7. The font looks a bit strange in IE7&#8230; Anyway, I&#8217;ll be fiddling with it some more over time. Let me know if something doesn&#8217;t look right in your browser.

I know the sidebar isn&#8217;t very elegant (especially the photos/movies/music links). I am soooo bad at design. Fooling around with those 3 links took longer than anything else I&#8217;ve done with this update. Every time I tried to get fancy, the layout would go to hell. I have grand ideas &#8211; really.
