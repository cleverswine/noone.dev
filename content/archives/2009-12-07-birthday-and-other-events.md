[<img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" title="Gabriel Park" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2746/4154770782_f947a748b2_m_d.jpg?resize=240%2C161" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/sets/72157622923951762/detail/)For my birthday, I went to [Rogue](http://www.rogue.com/) (as I have done for the past 7 years in a row) and got a free beer and t-shirt.  Bren and I took the next day off of work and had a delicious meal at <a href="http://www.salvadormollys.com/" target="_blank">Salvador Molly&#8217;s</a> and took a hike around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Park" target="_blank">Gabriel Park</a>.  It was a fantastic birthday.  Now that I&#8217;m in my &#8220;late 30s&#8230;&#8221;, I may choose to do something different next year.  We&#8217;ll see.
