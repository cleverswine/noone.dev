I finally got upgraded to Windows XP at work. I was using Windows 2000 until now. I am currently reinstalling all of my development tools, giving me time to write on my web site (and clean up my desk). My reason for making an &#8220;urgent&#8221; request for Windows XP is that it has remote desktop capability built in. With this, I can VPN to work and then remote to my desktop. That basically means that I can use my work computer from home.
