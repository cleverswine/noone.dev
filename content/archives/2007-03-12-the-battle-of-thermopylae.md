We went to see _300_ this weekend. I had great expectations after watching the trailers and reading the <a href="http://filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&#038;Id=9860" target="_blank">reviews</a>. The battle scenes were some of the coolest movie scenes that I&#8217;ve experienced. As most reviews point out, they were very video-game-like, and very bloody. Unfortunately, outside of the battle scenes, there wasn&#8217;t much substance. We&#8217;re not given a lot of detail about the history of the Persians and Spartans, and why they are battling at the moment. The dialog is cheesy and not smart. I would have liked to see this as a 3 hour epic with more focus on historical facts, and, of course, more battle scenes. All in all, I&#8217;d give it 3.5 stars out of 5. To be fair, the movie is based on a comic, which is why I generously gave it 3.5 stars. My advice is to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UapGEIMQtkw" target="_blank">this unrated trailer</a>, read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae" target="_blank">this article</a>, and then pick up the DVD when it comes out.
