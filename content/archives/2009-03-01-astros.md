Spring training is here for Major League Baseball. I&#8217;m not sure what to think about this season. Things aren&#8217;t looking bright for my favorite team, the Houston Astros. They are [projected to be the worst team](http://baseballprojection.com/2009standings.htm) in baseball in 2009. Based on last year&#8217;s performance and our current roster, that projection could be accurate. Maybe I should follow the more geographically appropriate Mariners, but their season isn&#8217;t looking much better. Nor is Bren&#8217;s former home team, the Royals.
