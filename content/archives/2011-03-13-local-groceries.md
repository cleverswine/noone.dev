We did this week&#8217;s grocery shopping at <a title="Food Front" href="http://www.foodfront.coop/" target="_blank">Food Front</a> in the Hillsdale neighborhood.  They carry many local and organic food products.  And, it may be my imagination, but local eggs fresh from the chicken taste so much better than the mass produced commercial eggs.
