We got a bit of snow last night in Gresham. I&#8217;d say there was about 1.5&#8243; when I left for work this morning, and I think it&#8217;s supposed to snow some more throughout the day. In downtown Portland, there&#8217;s pretty much nothing. I should have worked from home today so I could have played in the snow.
