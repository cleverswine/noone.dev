My grandmother used to make the best cayenne pepper hot sauce. This summer, I planted a cayenne plant and got quite a few peppers. I harvested all of them yesterday and we&#8217;ve started the process of making hot sauce. It took a while to chop and seed them, and now our hands are stained with fire. We have to be careful what we touch (especially eyes). It would have been wise to wear gloves. In 3 months, the sauce will be ready for use. I have high hopes!
