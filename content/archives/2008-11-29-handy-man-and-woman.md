Tonight we bought and installed an over the stove microwave oven. The most impressive part (or, the part that I&#8217;m proudest of) is that we wired up and installed a new electrical outlet. There was an old (70s) vent hood above the stove, and we severed the cord and rewired it to an outlet. All in all, it was a lot of work, and I&#8217;d be inclined to pay someone next time.
