We saw &#8220;[Charlie Wilson&#8217;s War](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472062/)&#8221; this weekend. Although it wouldn&#8217;t make the list of my favorite movies of all time, it was very well done. There was never a dull moment and I have no complaints about anything. [Philip Seymour Hoffman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000450/) does an amazing job in the role of Gust Avrakotos. He really should win some kind of award. The historical significance of the story is revealing and unsettling. Go see it.
