So the new tablet pc comes with a screenshot program that automatically takes a screenshot and uploads it to flickr.com. That is sooo cool! So far this gadget is perfect. Another suprising feature is that it works perfectly with Orb.com, which means I can watch TV and view all of the multimedia stored on my home server.
