A computer science student is studying under a tree and another pulls up on a flashy new bike. The first student asks, &#8220;Where&#8217;d you get that?&#8221;

The student on the bike replies, &#8220;While I was studying outside, a beautiful girl pulled up on her bike. She took off all her clothes and said, &#8216;You can have anything you want&#8217;.&#8221;

The first student responds, &#8220;Good choice! Her clothes probably wouldn&#8217;t have fit you.&#8221;
