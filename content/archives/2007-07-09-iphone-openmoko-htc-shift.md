I&#8217;ve been hacking away at my Sharp Zaurus for a couple of years now. It has brought me great pleasure, but I&#8217;m in need of a new toy. Anyone&#8217;s input is appreciated. At the moment, my options are:

**iPhone**:   
Pros: It looks nice and does lots of cool stuff (I assume). There will be a large software repository due to it&#8217;s popularity.  
Cons: It&#8217;s Apple. I don&#8217;t want a machine so tightly coupled with a corporation.

**OpenMoko**:   
Pros: It runs a completely open source version of Linux, therefore it&#8217;s hackable.  
Cons: It&#8217;s hackable and I&#8217;ll break it.

**HTC Shift**:   
Pros: Powerful enough to run Windows Vista (which I happen to like). It&#8217;s small enough to tote.  
Cons: It&#8217;s a lot like what I already have, and I paid $400 for what I have.
