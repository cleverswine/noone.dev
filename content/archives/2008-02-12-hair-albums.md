When I was a teenager, I collected locks of hair from all of my female friends and girlfriends. I must have had 30 clumps of hair, each tied neatly with a piece of ribbon. At the time, I thought there was nothing strange about it. In retrospect, however, it seems a bit psycho. I mention this because I just read an [article about this year&#8217;s President&#8217;s Day](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23103392/).

> For the first time, The Academy of Natural Sciences is displaying a scrapbook that has locks of hair from the first 12 U.S. presidents.

Who knew The Academy of Natural Sciences is psycho like a teenage me.
