I would not normally advocate Wal-Mart, as they are evil in so many ways, but I&#8217;ve been reading the Wal-Mart blog lately. It&#8217;s called [Check Out](http://checkoutblog.com/default.aspx). I don&#8217;t know exactly who the &#8220;associates&#8221; are that write on this blog, but it does bring a human side to the company. Obviously, it&#8217;s a marketing ploy, but I still enjoy reading it. It is G rated and censored (no foul language allowed), like the store. I wonder if they will address their unfair business practices that bring other companies to their knees? I doubt it.
