From the [Beaumont Enterprise](http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19470549&#038;BRD=2287&#038;PAG=461&#038;dept_id=512588&#038;rfi=6) (in Texas, where I grew up):

> West Brook High School administrators on Wednesday defended a black-male-only mentoring session that has prompted a recent inquiry by the American Civil Liberties Union.

So, this high school in Beaumont decides to call an assembly of students to address issues such as education, test scores, crime, family and gangs. Good for them, except&#8230; they only invited black males! Now the ACLU is mad, and the school district is puzzled. A lot of people are trying to justify the assembly based on crime statistics, but, as [The Bayou](http://setxbayou.blogspot.com/2008/04/black-and-white-west-brooks-black-male.html) pointed out, if school organizers are being surgical with their message, why include ALL black males, some of whom are already model students? I don&#8217;t think it can be justified, and I think the ACLU should be all over them. I&#8217;m glad they are trying to address a problem, but come on &#8211; use a little tact.
