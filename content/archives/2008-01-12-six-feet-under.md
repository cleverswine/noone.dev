What a great show that was! I was a little unsure about the ending, but now that I&#8217;ve had time to absorb it, I think it&#8217;s brilliant. For those who don&#8217;t know, the show was an HBO series about a family that runs and lives in a funeral home. The character development is wonderful, and the shooting style is similar to that of American Beauty (same writer/director). There is a lot of death in the show, but it achieves it&#8217;s goal of making us face death and realize that it&#8217;s a part of life.
