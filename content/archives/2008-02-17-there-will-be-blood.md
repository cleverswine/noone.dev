We saw [_There Will Be Blood_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/) last night. It was really good, except we&#8217;re not completely sure what it was about. Was it about capitalism, family, greed, religion, or some combination? It may have been helpful to read Upton Sinclair&#8217;s _Oil!_ first, but neither of us have. The movie was based on the book. Despite the lost meaning, it was a captivating and memorable movie. I had nightmares featuring Mr. Plainview last night.
