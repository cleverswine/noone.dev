title: Kohl&#8217;s

<a href="http://www.kohls.com/main/home.jsp" target="_blank">Kohl&#8217;s</a> had a grand opening sale today in Gresham. I&#8217;ve never been to a Kohl&#8217;s before and now I know where I&#8217;ll be buying most of my clothing. Their stuff is insanely cheap, and high quality (brand names). Today, I bought 15 pairs of black socks for about $18 total! I&#8217;ll be disposing of my current inventory of socks and I&#8217;ll never have to match them up again &#8211; because my 15 pairs are all exactly the same! This idea was inspired by GTD (Getting Things Done) on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/" target="_blank">43 Folders</a>. I can&#8217;t find the original article, but the site is full of useful information to simplify day to day things (such as pairing up socks).
