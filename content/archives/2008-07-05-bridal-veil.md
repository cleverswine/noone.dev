Went mailed off our wedding invitations from Bridal Veil, Oregon today. They have a tiny post office that has come to cater to the postal needs of wedding parties. After dropping off the invitations, we took a small hike around the Bridal Veil waterfall. [Photos on flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/).
