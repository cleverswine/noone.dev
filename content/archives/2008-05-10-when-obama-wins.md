[When Obama wins](http://kottke.org/when-obama-wins/)&#8230;

Starbucks will stop referring to their smalls as talls.
  
Your recycling will sort itself and magically appear by the curb.
  
Charlie Brown will finally kick that football.
  
Your cell phone won&#8217;t work in your car, at the movies, or while you&#8217;re ahead of me in line for coffee.
  
People will have more picnics in the park.
