Yesterday I wrote about my brilliant idea of walking around Portland taking photos. I would post the photo here with some information about where I took it.

Today, I saw an improved version of my idea posteed on delicious. It&#8217;s called [CommunityWalk](http://www.communitywalk.com/). I think they did a fine job with the implementation. I might even use it at some point.
