I&#8217;ve been working unusually hard lately, and by &#8220;working&#8221; I mean sitting in front of computers solving complex problems. Coincidentally, I&#8217;ve lost a couple of pounds this week. Now I&#8217;m wondering if thinking burns calories. Am I burning calories by thinking about the possibility of thinking burning calories? The brain is an amazing machine! Now, if only I could upgrade my processor and memory, and rewire a few circuits.
