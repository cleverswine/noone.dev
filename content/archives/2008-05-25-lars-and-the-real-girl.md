We watched [Lars and the Real Girl](http://www.larsandtherealgirl-themovie.com/) last night. It&#8217;s one of the best movies I&#8217;ve seen in a while, right up there with other popular independents like Juno and Little Miss Sunshine. It&#8217;s billed as a comedy, but it was actually a moving drama with a comedic base. I almost cried, which means that the movie was very well written and directed &#8211; especially considering that the co-star is an inflatable sex doll. I think everyone would enjoy this movie, so see it if you get a chance.

Meanwhile, we&#8217;re going to see the new Indiana Jones movie this afternoon. I&#8217;ll report on that later&#8230;
