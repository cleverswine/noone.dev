It&#8217;s a warm and sunny day here in Portland. **Not.** It&#8217;s actually a freezing and sunny day over here. I just walked to get lunch and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever been so cold! I think it&#8217;s about 30+ degrees, but the wind is blowing hard. If it&#8217;s going to be this cold, we should at least get snow out of it! We get enough sunshine in the summer.
