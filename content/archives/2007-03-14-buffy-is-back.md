After seven fabulous seasons of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, writer Joss Whedon has begun work on season eight &#8211; [in comic book form](http://www.darkhorse.com/zones/buffy/index.php). The comic is being published by local company [Dark Horse Comics](http://www.darkhorse.com/company/overview.php). I have already pre-ordered the first 3 issues, plus issue #1 with an alternate cover. I&#8217;d rather continue to see Buffy as a television show, but a comic will do.

**Update**, March 16: [Buffy: Season 8 #1 sells out &#8211; gets second printing!](http://forevergeek.com/entertainment/buffy_season_8_1_sells_out_-_gets_second_printing.php)
