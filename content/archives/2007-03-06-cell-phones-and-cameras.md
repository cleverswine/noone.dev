I&#8217;ve never wanted a cell phone with a camera on it because I&#8217;m all about separation of functionality. I want a camera that works well, a phone that works well, a calculator that works well, etc etc. When you start combining unrelated functionality into one &#8220;gadget&#8221;, you lose quality in the individual pieces. However, these days it&#8217;s nearly impossible to get a decent phone without a camera built in, so now I have one. I disposed of my old Nokia and got the [Motorolla Razr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_RAZR_V3). I have to admit, it&#8217;s kind of neat having a 1.3 megapixel camera tucked away in my tiny phone. Some photos from my phone are on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/).
