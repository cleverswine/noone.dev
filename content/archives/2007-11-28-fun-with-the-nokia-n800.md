title: Fun with the Nokia n800

The more I use my [Nokia n800 internet tablet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N800), the more I like it. I recently upgraded the OS to Nokia&#8217;s latest release (which was developed for the follow up model, the n810). Today I discovered that I can use the n800&#8217;s bluetooth to connect to my cell phone and transfer files back and forth. I could also use my cell phone for internet connectivity, but I don&#8217;t have the network plan from AT&#038;T. That&#8217;s too bad since [Portland&#8217;s free wifi](http://www.metrofi.com/) near downtown, which was all the rage, barely works. Anyway, I use the n800 for browsing the web, reading email, IM chatting, reading RSS feeds, music, video, and more. It&#8217;s great for when I&#8217;m laying in bed wondering what a &#8220;[dreidel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel)&#8221; is &#8211; I can just grab my n800 and look it up instantly without leaving the bed. The bad news is that I paid $400 for it and they are now on sale just about everywhere for $200+. Doh!
