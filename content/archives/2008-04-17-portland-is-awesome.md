Just in case someone doesn&#8217;t already know, Portland is awesome. Some of our local [techies](http://siliconflorist.com/) and [bloggers](http://fastwonderblog.com/) have started a new web site where various citizens of P-town can express why they think our city is cool. I was wondering if they would get enough authors to make it worthwhile, but sure enough the articles keep on coming.

If you are interested at all in the culture and general environment of Portland, I would recommend reading [PortlandIsAwesome.com](http://portlandisawesome.com/) regularly. Maybe one day I&#8217;ll even contribute.
