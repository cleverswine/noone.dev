The longer I use WordPress, the more I like it. It has quite a few features, but they don&#8217;t get in the way of simplicity. I&#8217;m finding it easy to add content, pages, and links, all &#8220;willy-nilly&#8221;. Customizing the appearance isn&#8217;t that difficult if you&#8217;re familiar with CSS and/or PHP. There are also &#8220;plugins&#8221; galore, such as [these](http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/PluginDirectory). A good experience so far.

I might also mention thatÂ  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.a2hosting.com/ruby_on_rails_hosting.php">a2</a> web hosting has been phenomenal so far.
