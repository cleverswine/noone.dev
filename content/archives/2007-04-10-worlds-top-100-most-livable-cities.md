According to Business Week&#8217;s [&#8220;World&#8217;s Top 100 Most Livable Cities&#8221;](http://bwnt.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/livable_cities_worldwide/), Portland is the 46th most livable city in the world. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s quite impressive considering that there are only 8 U.S. cities in the top 50. It looks like Switzerland is really the place to be.
