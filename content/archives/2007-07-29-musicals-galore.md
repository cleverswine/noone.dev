We saw [Hairspray](http://www.hairspraymovie.com/) last night, which is the movie version of the Broadway musical which is based on a movie by [John Waters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Waters_(filmmaker)). I was pleased to see a cameo by John Waters at the beginning, as I am a fan of his. The movie was pretty good, and does the original justice. If you can tolerate a musical I&#8217;d recommend it.

Tonight we are going to see [Mama Mia](http://www.mamma-mia.com/), which is a musical play featuring music from Abba. I happen to like Abba, otherwise I&#8217;d be hesitant to see something of this sort.
