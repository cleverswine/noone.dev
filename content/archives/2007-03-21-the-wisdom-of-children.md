From an [article in the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2007/03/26/070326sh_shouts_rich):

_A Conversation at the Grownup Table, as Imagined at the Kidsâ€™ Table_

MOM: Pass the wine, please. I want to become crazy.
  
DAD: O.K.
  
GRANDMOTHER: Did you see the politics? It made me angry.

DAD: Me, too. When it was over, I had sex.
  
UNCLE: Iâ€™m having sex right now.
  
DAD: We all are.
  
MOM: Letâ€™s talk about which kid I like the best.
  
DAD: (_laughing_) You know, but you wonâ€™t tell.

MOM: If they ask me again, I might tell.
  
FRIEND FROM WORK: Hey, guess what! My voice is pretty loud!
  
DAD: (_laughing_) There are actual monsters in the world, but when my kids ask I pretend like there arenâ€™t.

MOM: Iâ€™m angry! Iâ€™m angry all of a sudden!
  
DAD: Iâ€™m angry, too! Weâ€™re angry at each other!
  
MOM: Now everything is fine.
  
DAD: We just saw the PG-13 movie. It was so good.
  
MOM: There was a big sex.

FRIEND FROM WORK: I am the loudest! I am the loudest!
  
(_Everybody laughs_.)
  
MOM: I had a lot of wine, and now Iâ€™m crazy!
  
GRANDFATHER: Hey, do you guys know what God looks like?

ALL: Yes.
  
GRANDFATHER: Donâ€™t tell the kids.
