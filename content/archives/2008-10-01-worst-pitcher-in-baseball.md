title: Worst Pitcher in Baseball

One of my regular reads is [FanGraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/), which is a site about baseball players and statistics. I&#8217;ve been questioning the Astros&#8217; decision to keep Brandon Backe for a while, and FanGraphs backs up my opinion in an [article published today](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/the-bottom-five/).

> Brandon Backe just may be the worst pitcher in baseball consistently given start after start&#8230; Why this man still gets paid to pitch in the major leagues befuddles me.

Meanwhile, the MLB playoffs are starting and I have no team to cheer for. I don&#8217;t care for any of the NL teams, and I&#8217;m not familiar with any of the AL teams. As usual, I&#8217;d prefer to see the NL win the World Series. I&#8217;d probably lean towards the Brewers (strong lineup) or the Phillies (Brad Lidge). As for the AL, maybe the Devil Rays since they had such a turnaround season. For the most part though, I don&#8217;t care who wins.
