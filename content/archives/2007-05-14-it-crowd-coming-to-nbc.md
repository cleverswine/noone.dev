According to [this article](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070514/media_nm/nbc_dc), my favorite geek TV show, The IT Crowd, is coming to NBC. The show is about misunderstood IT workers, and is hilarious. It currently only airs in Britain and can also be [watched online](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/index.html).
