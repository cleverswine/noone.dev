I&#8217;m debating whether or not to attend this year&#8217;s [Convergence](http://www.convergence13.com/), which is here in Portland.

> Convergence is an annual gothic-industrial festival, now in its 13th year. It is a chance for many goths and others who normally only meet on the Internet to come together in real life. Convergence is held in North America, in a different location each year voted on by previous attendees.

Once a goth, always a goth, eh? I would like to see some of the bands that are playing. Specifically, Skinny Puppy, Faith and the Muse, and FrontLine Assmebly. I wouldn&#8217;t care so much for the art and fashion, which brings to question the price of the event: $75.
