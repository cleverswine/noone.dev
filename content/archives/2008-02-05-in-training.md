This week, I am in a training class for [IBM Websphere](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/websphere/). What is Websphere? Well, it&#8217;s something along the lines of an integration and application infrastructure software built around J2EE (Java framework). Visit the web site for more information, and good luck trying to figure it out.
