Our new deck is complete and it&#8217;s much nicer than the old one. The flooring is composite material from TimberTech and the railing is aluminum. We plan to stain the wood skirting to better match the deck and house color, but we&#8217;ll have to wait until it stops raining. As a bonus, we have a decent sized storage area underneath part of the deck.
