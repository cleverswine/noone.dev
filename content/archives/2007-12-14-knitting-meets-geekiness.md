I may have found something geeky that Bren and I can have in common. I&#8217;m talking about [KnitML](http://www.knitml.com/blog/). KnitML is a new markup language (like html or xml) used to describe knitting patterns. How geeky is that?

> The KnitML Project&#8217;s main goal is to develop and promote adoption of a standard content model for knitting patterns. By developing a community-supported specification (KnitML) and providing basic rendering and transformation tools, the KnitML Project aims to make KnitML easy to use and valuable to the knitter.
