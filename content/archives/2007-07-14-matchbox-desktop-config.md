title: Matchbox Desktop Config

I&#8217;m working on a new project for my PDA. The application will allow for configuring the [Matchbox Desktop](http://matchbox-project.org/documentation/manual/mbdesktop.html) (which is the user interface for my PDA). Without this application, users of Matchbox (on a PDA anyway) must edit a series of configuration files in order to create folders and move programs from folder to folder. My program allows for adding/editing/deleting applications and folders. It&#8217;s written in Python 2.4 using the GTK library for UI. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of my alpha version:
