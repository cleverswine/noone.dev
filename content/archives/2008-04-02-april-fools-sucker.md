Well, I got fooled left and right yesterday! I guess I am naive&#8230;

My favorite embedded device developer, Marcin Juszkiewicz, claimed that he was [moving from Poland to London](http://blog.haerwu.biz/2008/04/01/moving-to-london/) for work. He said that with his new job, he could spend more time in the office and less time taking care of his child. Sounded reasonable to me. [He was kidding](http://blog.haerwu.biz/2008/04/02/no-i-am-not-moving-to-london/).

I&#8217;m still not clear about this one, but seeing as it was tagged on delicious as &#8220;aprilfools&#8221;, I&#8217;m guessing it wasn&#8217;t real. Too bad, because I was hyped about it.

Probably the most unbelievable prank that I fell for was [Virgle](http://www.google.com/virgle/index.html), the joint venture between Google and Virgin to send humans to Mars. Hey, you never know what Google is capable of&#8230;

And that&#8217;s everything I&#8217;m willing to fess up to. Until next year.
