Since I&#8217;m pretty much stuck in the house due to the snow (and lack of a job), I&#8217;ve decided to learn something new. I&#8217;ve begun writing a [Windows Presentation Foundation](http://windowsclient.net/) (WPF) application. WPF has some insanely cool UI features, including declarative UI effects. My first project is a simple screensaver that pulls photos from Flickr and displays them as a slideshow with cool transition effects. Eventually, I&#8217;d like to create a dashboard type application that displays news, weather, email, etc. The dashboard will be more UI intensive, so I&#8217;m not quite ready for that. Creating WPF forms is very different than creating traditional Windows forms.
