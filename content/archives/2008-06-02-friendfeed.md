So I&#8217;ve been using FriendFeed for a few months now. It basically aggregates my online activity (mostly via &#8220;social&#8221; networks like Facebook and Flickr) and then provides a feed for anyone to consume. It&#8217;s not a bad idea, but it&#8217;s really too bad that we need something like this. I think it&#8217;s a sign that the social web is out of control. Anyway, I find it useful to track what my friends are doing on the web, since we have similar interests. To see what it looks like, check my feed here: <http://friendfeed.com/cleverswine>.

Meanwhile, I [twittered](http://twitter.com/) for the first time last week. It wasn&#8217;t as good as people say it is. I&#8217;m unfulfilled.
