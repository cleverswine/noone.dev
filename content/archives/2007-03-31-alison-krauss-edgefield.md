Alison Krauss will be at [Macmenamins Edgefield](http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=3&#038;id=484&#038;eventid=49614) on July 5, and we got great seats: 8 rows back in the center. I saw her once in San Francisco, but it was a huge outdoor concert under the Golden Gate bridge and I didn&#8217;t hear much. This concert at the Edgefield will be more intimate and we&#8217;ll be much closer.
