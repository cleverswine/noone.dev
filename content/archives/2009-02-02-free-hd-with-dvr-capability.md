I bought a PCTV 800e HD TV tuner card from [Woot!](http://www.woot.com/) some time ago, but never really used it. While watching _The Office_ last night in high definition (using a cheap HD antenna, not a cable or satellite subscription), we were wishing that we could pause the show as we do with our DirecTV service. That&#8217;s when I remembered my tuner card purchase and decided to get that set up with our media PC today. The plan was to hook it up to the media PC that is connected to our LCD television and then use Windows Media Center as a DVR. It was amazingly simple! I plugged in the USB tuner, installed the driver, started up WMC and ran through the TV setup wizard. We can now DVR HD television, and we get better sound because the media PC has an optical audio connect to our high end receiver. We also get program listings, which we didn&#8217;t get with just an antenna and TV. Yummy screenshots&#8230;
