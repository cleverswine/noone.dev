[Joss Whedon](http://imdb.com/name/nm0923736/) (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, etc.) is coming back to television! His new show is called &#8220;The Dollhouse&#8221; and stars [Eliza Dushku](http://imdb.com/name/nm0244630/) (_Faith_, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer)! It will air on Fox sometime next year. Unfortunately, the writer&#8217;s strike will postpone it for a while, but Fox has already agreed to 7 episodes.
