Today, we went to the Huckleberry Festival up near Mt Hood. It was disappointing, but we did get a delicious huckleberry shortcake and a huckleberry shake. After that, we took a hike on the nearby Old Salmon River Trail. Finally, we saw Superbad. I saw it as the current generation&#8217;s &#8220;Fast Times&#8230;&#8221;. Bren wasn&#8217;t quite that impressed, but liked it.
