I&#8217;m taking a small vacation to Seattle this weekend. We&#8217;ll be seeing the [Red Sox vs. Mariners](http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=sea) on Sunday, and then we&#8217;re going to [Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/) on Monday. Before we take off to Seattle, we&#8217;re going to see [Bill Maher](http://www.billmaher.com/) here in P-town.

I saw something disturbing yesterday: there are [some crazy people](http://www.harpers.org/rapture-ready-20060718001.html) that think the current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is a sign of the second coming of Christ, and they are happy about it.
