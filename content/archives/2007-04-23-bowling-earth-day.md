title: Bowling, Earth Day

We went bowling on Saturday at the newly renovated [Mt. Hood Lanes](http://mthoodlanes.com/) in Gresham. I did surprisingly well, with scores of 172 and 190. I think it was the lack of pressure, since it wasn&#8217;t a league situation. Unfortunately, I took no photos.

On Sunday, we went to the Gresham Earth Day celebration at City Hall. There wasn&#8217;t a whole lot there, and it was mostly for kids, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I&#8217;d say the highlights were seeing an owl perched on a man&#8217;s arm, and petting some snakes (including a python). I took some photos with my phone, but they aren&#8217;t uploaded yet.
