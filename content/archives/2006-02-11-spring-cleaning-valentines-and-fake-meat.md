title: Spring Cleaning, Valentine&#8217;s, and Fake Meat

We took some old computer hardware to <a href="http://freegeek.org" target="_blank">Free Geek</a> today. Bren had an old school Tandy and a dot matrix printer stored away in the closet. I meant to take photos, in case the computer museum needed them, but I forgot. Meanwhile, I received a fabulous Valentine&#8217;s Day present today (early, I know) &#8211; a Creative Zen Micro 6gb mp3 player! Very nice, very nice. And if that isn&#8217;t enough, we just ate stuffed bellpeppers made with fake ground meat. It was delicious.
