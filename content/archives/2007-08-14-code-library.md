I enhanced my code library application by applying an [Ext JS](http://extjs.com/) front end to it. The coolest part is the tree on the left. You can drag/drop code and categories to rearrange them and the changes are saved asynchronously to the database via ajax. I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;s user-friendly enough that I&#8217;ll start using it as a code sample repository.
