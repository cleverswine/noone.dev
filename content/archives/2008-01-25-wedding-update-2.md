There&#8217;s not a whole lot to report since my last update, but here goes. Bren (and her friends) has started looking at wedding dresses. Apparently she has found at least a couple that she really likes. I have no idea what they look like, as I&#8217;m following the traditional superstition rules. Meanwhile, I&#8217;m still working away on the reception music play list. The location (Viewpoint Inn) has changed what I had in mind for the music. I&#8217;m readjusting to fit the mood of the Inn. This weekend, we plan to put together a detailed task list and timeline in order to keep us on track. It&#8217;s amazing how many magazines and online publications offer up free wedding task lists. We&#8217;ll be consolidating all of those into one list that matches our needs.

[I think this is super cool.](http://offbeatbride.com/2007/08/bad-ass-bride-o-the-day) I&#8217;d never do it, but you have to admire this guy for doing it.
