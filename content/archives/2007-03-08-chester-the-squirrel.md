Chester is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" target="_blank">squirrel</a> that lives in our back yard. He loves peanuts. We like to give him peanuts. He quickly learned that the humans in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House" target="_blank">big wooden box</a> have the goods. Now when we step outside, Chester cautiously creeps towards us with his mind on the next free peanut. Each time, he becomes less and less cautious. At this point, he will take the peanut from my hand. He&#8217;s still pretty jumpy, but hopefully he&#8217;ll figure out that we&#8217;re ok. I&#8217;ll get a photo at some point.
