title: Fun with the Google Chart API

I just finish developing another weight loss application with Ruby on Rails. For the most part, it&#8217;s nothing noteworthy &#8211; just your standard Rails MVC project with simple views. The one tiny noteworthy thing is that I made use of the [Google Chart API](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/) for charting the progress of one&#8217;s diet. I wouldn&#8217;t call it an API&#8230; it&#8217;s more like a URL query string specification. Anyway, I created a model attribute to mine one&#8217;s weigh-in history and produce a query string for the Google Chart API URL. It&#8217;s quite cool. I would post source code here, but I really just threw the program together in two days, and it&#8217;s ugly. The important thing is that it works and I&#8217;ll be the only one using it. Yes, I&#8217;m on a diet.
