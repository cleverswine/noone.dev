I&#8217;ve recently rediscovered the joy of comic books. Joss Whedon was kind enough to continue the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ T.V. series via comic book. Reading the Buffy comic has been just as fulfilling as watching the show. Now, in addition to Buffy, I am reading [The Umbrella Academy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Umbrella_Academy) which is written by Gerard way of [My Chemical Romance](http://www.mychemicalromance.com/). I admit, I was unsure about reading a comic written by a rock star, but so far it is really good. Both comics are published by Portland-based [Dark Horse Comics](http://www.darkhorse.com/index.php).
