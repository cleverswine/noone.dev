In my first full week of using Weight Watchers Online, I lost 2 pounds. I pretty much hit my weekly point allowance exactly. My goal this week is to end up 5 points below my allowance.

As for my review of the online experience, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a little better than a spreadsheet. Granted, there are features that I don&#8217;t use yet like forums and recipe searches. Still, the fact that I&#8217;m paying a monthly fee helps with motivation.
