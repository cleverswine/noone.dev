There is a large construction site just outside of my building at work. The banging of the machines is insanely loud. It&#8217;s tolerable from within the building, but when I walk outside, my eardrums are greeted with earthshaking (literally) noise. They are apparently building a new office high rise, right in front of the police building. Surely the employees there are angry because their view of the river and Mt. Hood will disappear. However, my fiance informs me that it&#8217;s mostly prisoners in that building, so maybe it&#8217;s for the best&#8230;
