We went back to the Viewpoint Inn today to take care of some wedding business. As luck would have it, today was a beautiful, mostly clear day. As luck would not have it, we didn&#8217;t bring a real camera. As luck would have it, my cell phone has a camera on it. I took a handful of photos and added them to [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/).

This is my favorite photo from today&#8217;s trip. It&#8217;s their **chicken coop**!
