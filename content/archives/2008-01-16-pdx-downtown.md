I had a brilliant idea. Since I work in downtown Portland, and frequently take walks around the city, I thought I&#8217;d take photos of interesting things and post them here. I was going to start today during lunch, but it&#8217;s way too friggin&#8217; cold out there. I had to speed walk back to the heated office. I did get a decent shot of the parking garage that I park in. Woo hoo.
