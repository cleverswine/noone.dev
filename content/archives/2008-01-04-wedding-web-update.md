I am working on a custom-built website for our wedding which will contain tons of information about us and the big day. As we don&#8217;t even know where the wedding will be, the web site is far from done. Below is a sneak preview of what it will look like. Ignore the wedding date &#8211; that&#8217;s just a placeholder.
