For those who know what I do for a living, but don&#8217;t actually know what I do, I submit this link to an article called [What Is Programming?](http://bytes.com/forum/thread641516.html) If you would like to know what my levels of enthusiasm are, [check here](http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/377676.aspx).

These are things that I am _not_: web designer, tech support, network engineer, and a bunch of other things that I can&#8217;t think of right off hand. I&#8217;ve not eaten today because I&#8217;ve been inspired and wired.
