[Morrissey](http://cleverswine.net/?page_id=126) has announced his [U.S. tour dates](http://true-to-you.net/), and Portland is not on the list! He&#8217;s not even stopping in Oregon. There are cities on the list that I&#8217;ve never even heard of &#8211; but no Portland. His last show here was a huge success, and I know he has a loyal following here. My only theory is that Morrissey is trying to avoid Johnny Marr, who is currently calling Portland home. It&#8217;s all very sad.
