My tiny Southeast Texas home of [Nederland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederland,_Texas) was recently [host to Hillary Clinton, Ted Danson, and Mary Steenburgen](http://midcountychronicle.com/news/2008/0312/community/008.html). 600 people showed up for Hillary&#8217;s campaign propaganda. I&#8217;d say she&#8217;s being pretty thorough to make a stop in Nederland. Maybe that&#8217;s how she won Texas. So strange. Meanwhile, Forest Whitaker was in nearby Beaumont doing his thing for Obama.
