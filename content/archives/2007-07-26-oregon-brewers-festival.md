It&#8217;s that time of the year again. The summer [Oregon Brewers Festival](http://www.oregonbrewfest.com/) is going on this weekend. I haven&#8217;t even looked at the beer list, but I walked over there to eat lunch today and checked it out. I know that I want Piny the Elder. We are all going tonight (Thursday) for a change, because it gets way too crowded on the weekend.
