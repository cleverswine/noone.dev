My parents visited us in Gresham this month. We took an Amtrak train to Seattle and watched the Mariners beat the Rangers. We also did the usual Seattle touristy things, like Pikes Market. Upon returning to Oregon, we went to the rhododendron gardens in Portland. There are photos on flicker &#8211; [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/sets/72157600088022193/).
