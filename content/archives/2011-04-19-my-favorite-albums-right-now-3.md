This is what I&#8217;m listening to&#8230;

**<a title="The Record" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fear/The+Record" target="_blank">The Record</a> by FEAR**

This is old school punk from the early 80s, when punk rock was a means of expression and rebellion.  This particular album is humorous and offensive, as punk should be.

**<a title="Gothic Kabbalah" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Therion/Gothic+Kabbalah" target="_blank">Gothic Kabbalah</a> by Therion**

This isn&#8217;t my favorite Therion album, but I&#8217;ve been listening to it a lot lately because of some catchy songs.  I find it good to write code to because it takes you to another world.

**<a title="Soviet Kitsch" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Regina+Spektor/Soviet+Kitsch" target="_blank">Soviet Kitsch</a> by Regina Spektor**

This is something that&#8217;s generally outside of my musical tastes, but I like her quirky voice and odd lyrics.  She reminds me of a disturbed version of Tori Amos.

**<a title="The Other Side of Time" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mary+Fahl/The+Other+Side+of+Time" target="_blank">The Other Side of Time</a> by Mary Fahl**

I once claimed that Tarja has the greatest female voice, but I actually meant Mary Fahl.  This album is completely not my style of music (folk/new age/soft rock), but her voice is irresistible and addictive.
