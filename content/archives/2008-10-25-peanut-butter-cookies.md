What&#8217;s good after a long day of intense yard work? Peanut butter cookies. I made them from scratch, with very little help from the wife. My only mistake was spraying cookie dough all over the walls with a poorly aimed electric beater. Oops. Now we&#8217;re going to watch some recorded episodes of Boston Legal and chow down.
