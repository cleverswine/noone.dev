As it turns out, however, I have little interest in this year’s Superbowl. I’m rooting for the Cardinals because they are the underdog. I was also just made aware that 3 teams share the record for the most championships, and the Steelers are one of those. The Cowboys are another, so I’d hate to see the Steelers pull ahead in that statistic. Meanwhile, my focus has been on NBA basketball, which I just discovered a passion for about 6 months ago. The Trailblazers are my team of course, and it has been an exciting season so far. We’ve been to one game here in Portland (my first NBA game ever), and I can’t wait to go again. There’s also MLB baseball, which has always been my favorite sport, and really the only professional sport of interest. I hate to admit that after watching basketball, I’m not nearly as excited about the upcoming baseball season as I would normally be. Basketball is fast-paced and there’s a reasonable number of games per season. Contrary to my previous belief, basketball can be a thinking man’s game and the talent of individual players is apparent. Baseball is slow, the games are way to long, and there are way too many games in the season. I’m not saying that my interest in the NBA has surpassed the MLB… not yet. We’ll see how this baseball season works out.</p>
