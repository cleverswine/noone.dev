    <p>We went bowling on Saturday at the newly renovated <a href="http://mthoodlanes.com/">Mt. Hood Lanes</a> in Gresham. I did surprisingly well, with scores of 172 and 190. I think it was the lack of pressure, since it wasn’t a league situation. Unfortunately, I took no photos.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we went to the Gresham Earth Day celebration at City Hall. There wasn’t a whole lot there, and it was mostly for kids, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I’d say the highlights were seeing an owl perched on a man’s arm, and petting some snakes (including a python). I took some photos with my phone, but they aren’t uploaded yet.</p>
