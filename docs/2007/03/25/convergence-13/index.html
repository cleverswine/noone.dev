    <p>I’m debating whether or not to attend this year’s <a href="http://www.convergence13.com/">Convergence</a>, which is here in Portland.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Convergence is an annual gothic-industrial festival, now in its 13th year. It is a chance for many goths and others who normally only meet on the Internet to come together in real life. Convergence is held in North America, in a different location each year voted on by previous attendees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a goth, always a goth, eh? I would like to see some of the bands that are playing. Specifically, Skinny Puppy, Faith and the Muse, and FrontLine Assmebly. I wouldn’t care so much for the art and fashion, which brings to question the price of the event: $75.</p>
