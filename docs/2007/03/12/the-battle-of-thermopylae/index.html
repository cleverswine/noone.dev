    <p>We went to see <em>300</em> this weekend. I had great expectations after watching the trailers and reading the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reviews<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The battle scenes were some of the coolest movie scenes that I’ve experienced. As most reviews point out, they were very video-game-like, and very bloody. Unfortunately, outside of the battle scenes, there wasn’t much substance. We’re not given a lot of detail about the history of the Persians and Spartans, and why they are battling at the moment. The dialog is cheesy and not smart. I would have liked to see this as a 3 hour epic with more focus on historical facts, and, of course, more battle scenes. All in all, I’d give it 3.5 stars out of 5. To be fair, the movie is based on a comic, which is why I generously gave it 3.5 stars. My advice is to watch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this unrated trailer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and then pick up the DVD when it comes out.</p>
