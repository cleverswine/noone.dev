      <description>This is the first in a multi-part series that will show how to easily get Kubernetes up and running in Windows and deploy a sample application. Almost everything also applies to Linux, MacOS, etc.
The source code for this example can be found at https://github.com/cleverswine/hello-k8s-win
These posts are based on an intoductory presentation that I gave to my company.
Sample Application Consider a simple message processing application, as shown here:</description>

      <description>Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem, regardless of the choice of data processing framework, data model or programming language.
I&amp;rsquo;ll look at 3 interesting ways to peek into parquet files.
1) Jupyter Notebooks as a Simple Viewer Using a Jupyter Notebook with pyarrow and pandas
2) PyQt5 for a Native GUI Using Python, pyarrow, and PyQt5 to display a simple, cross-platform, native UI table.</description>

      <description>This is a comparison of bounded parallel processing with error handling and cancellation in Go and .NET.
The sample code will take an array of strings and print the ASCII code representation of each string in parallel. For example &amp;ldquo;Lorem&amp;rdquo; would evaluate to Lorem/76/111/114/101/109/. If a string is empty, an error occurs and processing is canceled.
First, the Go code.
package main import ( &amp;#34;context&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; &amp;#34;golang.org/x/sync/errgroup&amp;#34; ) func main() { parallelLimit := 4 testData := strings.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking for a while about moving my simple web site and blog to a different platform. I&amp;#8217;m currently paying to host everything on a traditional hosting service. Ten years ago, this was really the only option if you wanted buy a domain and put a web site out there (there was also self hosting with dynamic DNS, but I was never brave enough to open up my home network).</description>

      <description>This simple code snippet shows how to store and use cookies from a web request using the .Net HttpClient. For example, if an API or site sends a token or authentication cookie, you may need to store it and send it on all subsequent requests to show that you are authenticated. This would be for a session-based service. The key is to create a single CookieContainer instance and a single HttpClientHandler instance to hold it.</description>

      <description>Scott Hanselman has been trumpeting Windows Live Writer for some time now. I’ve been hesitant to try it out because I’m a control freak and I was convinced that Live Writer wouldn’t do things correctly. Well, he blogged about it again today so I’m giving it a try (with this post). It was the comments on his post that swayed me.
Live Writer has improved quite a bit since last time I tried it.</description>

      <description>Our new deck is complete and it&amp;#8217;s much nicer than the old one. The flooring is composite material from TimberTech and the railing is aluminum. We plan to stain the wood skirting to better match the deck and house color, but we&amp;#8217;ll have to wait until it stops raining. As a bonus, we have a decent sized storage area underneath part of the deck.</description>

      <description>AngularJS is an MVC framework for javascript. It is best suited for round-tripping resources with a RESTful service. In this post, I will simply get a list of recent tracks from Last.fm, treating each track as a resource. The Last.fm API is documented here. There is no round-tripping in this example. I&amp;#8217;ll also be utilizing Twitter Bootstrap for layout.
To start, create the AngularJS application and a controller for recent tracks.</description>

      <description>I recently created a thumbnail gallery of my latest Flickr photos using the Flickr feeds API, Twitter Bootstrap, and Javascript/jQuery. There is no server side code for this solution, and the client side code is really simple. To start, create a blank html page (I like to start with the HTML5 Boilerplate). Make sure you include the Bootstrap css and jQuery. I used the Thumbnails component of Bootstrap for the gallery layout.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a new Rails application for storing our recipes. It&amp;#8217;s at a point where it is being hosted and used by us. Some of the style is borrowed (stolen) from Martha Stewart&amp;#8217;s blog.
The big feature of La Cocina is it&amp;#8217;s ability to pull in recipes from a number of other recipe sites. I&amp;#8217;m using the nokogiri gem to do screen scraping for recipe data. There&amp;#8217;s an admin interface for creating new screen scrapers (which I call &amp;#8220;scarfers&amp;#8221;), so it&amp;#8217;s easy to add new recipe sites by entering DOM paths (CSS or XPath) and some other options.</description>

      <guid>/2012/06/07/show-svn-revision-number-in-a-rails-application/</guid>
      <description>This is a hack to display the Subversion revision in a Rails application using Capistrano to insert the current revision number on each deploy.
Create a partial that will contain the revision number. For example, _~/app/views/layouts/revision.html.erb. You can put anything in that file, as it will be overwritten by Capistrano on each deploy. The word &amp;#8220;Development&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Current&amp;#8221; seems a good choice.
In the page where you want to display the revision number (probably in the application layout), render the partial.</description>

      <description>As I was researching patterns and practices for a WCF client implementation, I came across a bug in the .Net implementation of ClientBase (whether it&amp;#8217;s actually a bug is arguable). It&amp;#8217;s well documented on the web, but it could cause major headaches if you happened to miss it.
The core of the issue is that ClientBase implements IDisposable. With this knowledge, just about any programmer would naturally wrap its usage in a using{} block.</description>

The first thing I was doing&amp;#8230;
 ps aux | grep Foo
 find the process ID (PID) with my eyes, and then kill it&amp;#8230;
 kill -9 123456
 Next, I started finding complex piped commands to find and extract the PID.</description>

We&amp;#8217;ve barely reached the 80s in temperature, and we&amp;#8217;ve had more rain than usual. However, despite the lack of veggies, I&amp;#8217;m personally enjoying the cool summer.</description>

      <description>I recently worked on a project in which 90% of its tests were integration tests because the core purpose of the project was to interact with external entities. In an effort create more unit tests, I employed Moq (and lots of refactoring). This is an example of basic Moq usage.
Let&amp;#8217;s say we have a repository that gets documents from a database. The assumption is that a repository interface, IDocumentRepository, is being implemented.</description>

The Record by FEAR
This is old school punk from the early 80s, when punk rock was a means of expression and rebellion. This particular album is humorous and offensive, as punk should be.
Gothic Kabbalah by Therion
This isn&amp;#8217;t my favorite Therion album, but I&amp;#8217;ve been listening to it a lot lately because of some catchy songs. I find it good to write code to because it takes you to another world.</description>

      <description>I was recently tasked with validating XML files against a very complex set of XSD schema files. This is easily accomplished if your XSD files live on the filesystem, because the .Net xml resolver can find referenced schemas via a relative or absolute Uri. In my case, the schema files were compiled as embedded resources in my project. As expected, the XML schema loader didn&amp;#8217;t know how to find referenced schemas &amp;#8211; it was likely searching for them in the path of the running application.</description>

      <description>We did this week&amp;#8217;s grocery shopping at Food Front in the Hillsdale neighborhood. They carry many local and organic food products. And, it may be my imagination, but local eggs fresh from the chicken taste so much better than the mass produced commercial eggs.</description>

      <description>I recently posted a brief summary of creating a recipe database. I decided to expand on that and go into the implementation details of using ASP.NET MVC3 with MongoDB and Autofac. This code depends on the NoRM driver for MongoDB, Autofac, and MVC3 (and it&amp;#8217;s dependencies). This is by no means the only (or best) way to do things, but this is how I chose to do it. I&amp;#8217;ve simplified the repository to one method for brevity, but you&amp;#8217;d obviously want to add all of the required CRUD operations.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve started on the Paleo Diet, which, of course, means I have to create a software application to go along with it.
I decided this was a good time to give MVC3 and MongoDB a test drive. After diving in, I realized that I could benefit from some dependency injection via MVC3&amp;#8217;s DependencyResolver. I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to learn Autofac, so I threw that in as the container. This was sweet, as it injected my repository implementations into my controllers with very little setup.</description>

      <description>These are my favorite albums, in no particular order&amp;#8230;
My Winter Storm by Tarja
Tarja used to sing with Nightwish, but has recently gone solo. She has one of the greatest female voices that I&amp;#8217;ve ever heard.
Beautiful Death by Bella Morte
This is still one of the best albums I&amp;#8217;ve heard in the past 10 years or so.
Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys by My Chemical Romace</description>

      <description>After a few weeks of shopping in and around Portland, we finally landed some nice office furniture at a reasonable price. City Liquidators turns out to be the place for furniture (and other things ranging from tampons to sofas). Next up, we&amp;#8217;ll be painting the room.</description>

      <description>On December 5th, we attended the Houston Rockets @ Portland Trailblazers game. We sat way up in the 300 section, but we had mid-court aisle seats which turned out to be quite nice. Portland won the game &amp;#8211; and they have won all 3 games we&amp;#8217;ve been to (against tough opponents). I think we bring good luck&amp;#8230; for wins. Unfortunately, we were witness to the season ending injury of Greg Oden.</description>

      <description>For my birthday, I went to Rogue (as I have done for the past 7 years in a row) and got a free beer and t-shirt. Bren and I took the next day off of work and had a delicious meal at Salvador Molly&amp;#8217;s and took a hike around Gabriel Park. It was a fantastic birthday. Now that I&amp;#8217;m in my &amp;#8220;late 30s&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;, I may choose to do something different next year.</description>

      <description>[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/4126822232/sizes/l/)New Couch We got our new couch from JCPenney last weekend. We weren&amp;#8217;t expecting it until mid-December because we had custom fabric put on it. We&amp;#8217;re glad to have it for Thanksgiving because we&amp;#8217;re having company over for food and games. I think the red (berry) fabric was a good choice, as it adds some color to the room and it matches the chair we recently purchased. The rug is new as well.</description>

      <description>We moved in to our new house Friday. I don&amp;#8217;t have many photos yet because we are still unpacking. So far, almost everything has gone well. DirecTV is unwilling to get on our roof to install the satellite dish. Apparently, it is unsafe. We&amp;#8217;ve asked for a second opinion from another installer, so we&amp;#8217;ll see. Other than that, all is good!
Some photos are here, with more to come as we get settled in.</description>
