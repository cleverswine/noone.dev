      <description>This post will show how to create a simple Vue.js single page application and host it in a docker container.
Create the application Install the Vue command line interface (cli) from here. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using yarn for this example..
yarn global add @vue/cli Create a new hello-world application and change into the application&amp;rsquo;s folder.
# this places the new application in a ./hello-world folder vue create hello-world cd hello-world yarn install Build a Docker image Now that we have a working Vue.</description>

      <description>Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format available to any project in the Hadoop ecosystem, regardless of the choice of data processing framework, data model or programming language.
I&amp;rsquo;ll look at 3 interesting ways to peek into parquet files.
1) Jupyter Notebooks as a Simple Viewer Using a Jupyter Notebook with pyarrow and pandas
2) PyQt5 for a Native GUI Using Python, pyarrow, and PyQt5 to display a simple, cross-platform, native UI table.</description>

      <description>This is a comparison of bounded parallel processing with error handling and cancellation in Go and .NET.
The sample code will take an array of strings and print the ASCII code representation of each string in parallel. For example &amp;ldquo;Lorem&amp;rdquo; would evaluate to Lorem/76/111/114/101/109/. If a string is empty, an error occurs and processing is canceled.
First, the Go code.
package main import ( &amp;#34;context&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; &amp;#34;golang.org/x/sync/errgroup&amp;#34; ) func main() { parallelLimit := 4 testData := strings.</description>

      <description>This simple code snippet shows how to store and use cookies from a web request using the .Net HttpClient. For example, if an API or site sends a token or authentication cookie, you may need to store it and send it on all subsequent requests to show that you are authenticated. This would be for a session-based service. The key is to create a single CookieContainerinstance and a single HttpClientHandlerinstance to hold it.</description>

Live Writer has improved quite a bit since last time I tried it.</description>

We plan to stain the wood skirting to better match the deck and house color, but we’ll have to wait until it stops raining. As a bonus, we have a decent sized storage area underneath part of the deck.</description>

      <description>AngularJSis an MVC framework for javascript. It is best suited for round-tripping resources with a RESTful service. In this post, I will simply get a list of recent tracks from Last.fm, treating each track as a resource. The Last.fm API is documented here. There is no round-tripping in this example. I’ll also be utilizing Twitter Bootstrapfor layout.
To start, create the AngularJS application and a controller for recent tracks. Since this is a simple application, there are no routes and views.</description>

      <description>I’ve been working on a new Rails application for storing our recipes. It’s at a point where it is being hosted and used by us. Some of the style is borrowed (stolen) from Martha Stewart’s blog.
The big feature of La Cocina is it’s ability to pull in recipes from a number of other recipe sites. I’m using the nokogirigem to do screen scraping for recipe data. There’s an admin interface for creating new screen scrapers (which I call “scarfers”), so it’s easy to add new recipe sites by entering DOM paths (CSS or XPath) and some other options.</description>

      <description>This is a hack to display the Subversion revision in a Rails application using Capistranoto insert the current revision number on each deploy.
Create a partial that will contain the revision number. For example, _~/app/views/layouts/revision.html.erb. You can put anything in that file, as it will be overwritten by Capistrano on each deploy. The word “Development” or “Current” seems a good choice.
In the page where you want to display the revision number (probably in the application layout), render the partial.</description>

      <description>As I was researching patterns and practices for a WCF client implementation, I came across a bug in the .Net implementation of ClientBase(whether it’s actually a bug is arguable). It’s well documented on the web, but it could cause major headaches if you happened to miss it.
The core of the issue is that ClientBaseimplements IDisposable. With this knowledge, just about any programmer would naturally wrap its usage in a using{} block.</description>

The first thing I was doing…
 ps aux | grep Foo
 find the process ID (PID) with my eyes, and then kill it…
 kill -9 123456
 Next, I started finding complex piped commands to find and extract the PID.</description>

      <description>I recently worked on a project in which 90% of its tests were integration tests because the core purpose of the project was to interact with external entities. In an effort create more unit tests, I employed Moq(and lots of refactoring). This is an example of basic Moq usage.
Let’s say we have a repository that gets documents from a database. The assumption is that a repository interface, IDocumentRepository, is being implemented.</description>

This is old school punk from the early 80s, when punk rock was a means of expression and rebellion. This particular album is humorous and offensive, as punk should be.
Gothic Kabbalahby Therion
This isn’t my favorite Therion album, but I’ve been listening to it a lot lately because of some catchy songs. I find it good to write code to because it takes you to another world.</description>

      <description>I was recently tasked with validating XML files against a very complex set of XSD schema files. This is easily accomplished if your XSD files live on the filesystem, because the .Net xml resolver can find referenced schemas via a relative or absolute Uri. In my case, the schema files were compiled as embedded resources in my project. As expected, the XML schema loader didn’t know how to find referenced schemas – it was likely searching for them in the path of the running application.</description>

This is by no means the only (or best) way to do things, but this is how I chose to do it. I’ve simplified the repository to one method for brevity, but you’d obviously want to add all of the required CRUD operations.</description>

      <description>I’ve started on the Paleo Diet, which, of course, means I have to create a software application to go along with it.
I decided this was a good time to give MVC3and MongoDBa test drive. After diving in, I realized that I could benefit from some dependency injection via MVC3’s DependencyResolver. I’ve been wanting to learn Autofac, so I threw that in as the container. This was sweet, as it injected my repository implementations into my controllers with very little setup.</description>

      <description>These are my favorite albums, in no particular order…
My Winter Stormby Tarja
Tarja used to sing with Nightwish, but has recently gone solo. She has one of the greatest female voices that I’ve ever heard.
Beautiful Deathby Bella Morte
This is still one of the best albums I’ve heard in the past 10 years or so.
Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoysby My Chemical Romace
I was pleasantly surprised by this new album from MCR.</description>

      <description>On December 5th, we attended the Houston Rockets @ Portland Trailblazers game. We sat way up in the 300 section, but we had mid-court aisle seats which turned out to be quite nice. Portland won the game – and they have won all 3 games we’ve been to (against tough opponents). I think we bring good luck… for wins. Unfortunately, we were witness to the season ending injury of Greg Oden.</description>

      <description>We got our new couch from JCPenney last weekend. We weren’t expecting it until mid-December because we had custom fabric put on it. We’re glad to have it for Thanksgiving because we’re having company over for food and games. I think the red (berry) fabric was a good choice, as it adds some color to the room and it matches the chair we recently purchased. The rug is new as well.</description>

      <description>We moved in to our new house Friday. I don’t have many photos yet because we are still unpacking. So far, almost everything has gone well. DirecTV is unwilling to get on our roof to install the satellite dish. Apparently, it is unsafe. We’ve asked for a second opinion from another installer, so we’ll see. Other than that, all is good!
Some photos are here, with more to come as we get settled in.</description>

      <description>I’ve been working on a project to read and update ID3 tags on my music collection. An ID3 tag is the meta data embedded in mp3 files that contains artist and other information. My initial goal is to batch update the “genre” field in my mp3 files. I’ve written a simple .Net forms application to do this. I found a really good library created by Novell called TagLib Sharp. The library makes it super easy to read and write ID3 tags.</description>

It has always been my favorite technical magazine because of it’s diversity of topics and brain-stirring articles. I got a letter in the mail last week saying that they were ceasing production of the full magazine. Instead, they will offer a Dr. Dobb’s Report stuffed into issues of InformationWeek. I’ll have to spend more time on their web site, as it looks like they have some good content on there.</description>

      <description>In my first full week of using Weight Watchers Online, I lost 2 pounds. I pretty much hit my weekly point allowance exactly. My goal this week is to end up 5 points below my allowance.
As for my review of the online experience, I’d say it’s a little better than a spreadsheet. Granted, there are features that I don’t use yet like forums and recipe searches. Still, the fact that I’m paying a monthly fee helps with motivation.</description>

Now that I’m paying $17 a month, I think I’ll stick to the plan.</description>

      <description>Spring training is here for Major League Baseball. I’m not sure what to think about this season. Things aren’t looking bright for my favorite team, the Houston Astros. They are projected to be the worst team in baseball in 2009. Based on last year’s performance and our current roster, that projection could be accurate. Maybe I should follow the more geographically appropriate Mariners, but their season isn’t looking much better. Nor is Bren’s former home team, the Royals.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since I’ve written about music, so here I go. My latest purchase is the new Morrissey album, Years of Refusal. I really like it. I would even say it’s one of his best solo albums to date. Sure, his voice has flattened out with age, but he makes up for it with his usual clever lyrics and well composed music from his band. This album is very rock n’ roll and has some catchy tunes.</description>

I’ve decided to jot down some random, and not so random, thoughts of my own about the process (with a focus on the tech industry).

      <description>I bought a PCTV 800e HD TV tuner card from Woot! some time ago, but never really used it. While watching The Office last night in high definition (using a cheap HD antenna, not a cable or satellite subscription), we were wishing that we could pause the show as we do with our DirecTV service. That’s when I remembered my tuner card purchase and decided to get that set up with our media PC today.</description>

As it turns out, however, I have little interest in this year’s Superbowl. I’m rooting for the Cardinals because they are the underdog. I was also just made aware that 3 teams share the record for the most championships, and the Steelers are one of those. The Cowboys are another, so I’d hate to see the Steelers pull ahead in that statistic.</description>

      <description>2009 is upon us. We as a country have a lot of improvements to make this year. I, as an individual, don’t have a lot of change in mind. My only big resolution is to lose some weight and get back into shape. I’ve let myself go since meeting Bren. I feel bad for her, because she thought she was getting involved with a lean, mean, programming machine. Now, I’m an unemployed fat slob (okay, that may be an exaggeration).</description>

      <description>Since I’m pretty much stuck in the house due to the snow (and lack of a job), I’ve decided to learn something new. I’ve begun writing a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. WPF has some insanely cool UI features, including declarative UI effects. My first project is a simple screensaver that pulls photos from Flickr and displays them as a slideshow with cool transition effects. Eventually, I’d like to create a dashboard type application that displays news, weather, email, etc.</description>

      <description>This is our back yard. I have no idea how many inches we have so far, but I’d roughly estimate 12″. It’s still coming down as of Monday morning. After driving to the MAX station this morning, I’m ready for the snow to be gone. Driving through it makes me very nervous.

      <description>Like most of the U.S., we’re getting our fair share of frigid weather in the Northwest. We got some snow on Sunday, and there’s plenty more to come in the next week. I’m excited, but I can definitely see why some people don’t want to live where it snows a lot. For ongoing photos of the Portland area snow storm of 2008, check the flickr pool: Portland Snow Day 2008. Also check mine.</description>

      <description>I just installed Windows Live Writer as a tool to publish stories to my web site. It has some promising features, and works with WordPress (yay MS).
I also just installed DropBox because I’ve been meaning to find a way to create offsite copies of some of our important files. I haven’t tried it yet, but I hear good things about it.
Hmm, now that I’m about to publish, I’m wondering if it will handle WordPress tags… it did not.</description>

      <description>Tonight we bought and installed an over the stove microwave oven. The most impressive part (or, the part that I’m proudest of) is that we wired up and installed a new electrical outlet. There was an old (70s) vent hood above the stove, and we severed the cord and rewired it to an outlet. All in all, it was a lot of work, and I’d be inclined to pay someone next time.</description>

      <description>The awful economy has finally hit home. Razorfish was forced to lay off quite a few people to deal with hard times, and I was one of those people. Fortunately, they gave me a good severance package and then there’s unemployment pay if it comes to that. Being a responsible person, I have a large sum of money saved up for a rainy day, so I’m not freaked out yet. The worst part of being jobless is the idleness (and it’s only been one day).</description>

      <description>I’m at the Chicago office this week, helping out on a .Net web project. I haven’t seen much of the city yet, but my first impression is that it’s big and old (old != bad). I’m staying about .75 miles from the office, so I might walk back to the hotel this evening and check things out on the way. I probably won’t get out much while I’m here, but if I do, I’ll be sure to take photos.</description>

This is a satellite view of the Portland metro area. In the lower right of the map, you can see all of the less populated space. According to rumors, that space will be the next piece of Portland to fall to shopping malls and crowded suburbs. We’re considering a house where the red dot is (next to Powell Butte).</description>

      <description>This morning I was browsing Weather Underground because there are lots of neat weather related features on that site (almanacs, astrology, maps galore, etc). I was looking through the various Portland weather stations and came across one called “Felony Flats, Portland, OR“. I thought that was pretty funny. What’s funnier is the link to the station’s web site: Coffin Cruisers Hearse Club of Portland. I had no idea there existed a community of people who drive hearses (and have personal weather stations).</description>

      <description>Since we’re searching for a house to buy, I’ve also been researching various neighborhoods around Portland. I’ve lived here long enough to be pretty familiar with all of Portland metro, but sometimes hard numbers add a little something. PortlandMaps.com has a decent tool for showing an overview, and details, of crime in Portland. The darker the red, the more crime there was in the past 12 months. I have to say, I’ve lived in some of the dark red areas (inner SE) and always felt safe.</description>

I’ve only tested in Firefox 3 and Internet Explorer 7. The font looks a bit strange in IE7… Anyway, I’ll be fiddling with it some more over time. Let me know if something doesn’t look right in your browser.
I know the sidebar isn’t very elegant (especially the photos/movies/music links). I am soooo bad at design.</description>

 Brandon Backe just may be the worst pitcher in baseball consistently given start after start… Why this man still gets paid to pitch in the major leagues befuddles me.</description>

      <description>We watched the season premiere of Heroes last night. We were warned by various sources that it would be bad, and they were not wrong. The story line seems desperate so far, as if the writers are more concerned about the hype than they are quality. The characters seem more shallow, and the dialog was just horrible (which can work in shows like “Buffy”, where dry humor and spoof are part of the game).</description>

      <description>We’ve started looking seriously at houses to buy. We even have a real estate agent (Leslie, a family of a friend). It’s supposed to be a buyer’s market, but I’ll tell you, houses in Portland are still outrageously priced. I believe I read that the average price here is more than $300k. However, I get the idea that sellers are more than willing to come down quite a bit in price.</description>

Today, we inadvertently started rearranging furniture in our house. We’ve made the living room look much larger and nicer. It was a bit exhausting and we had to cancel our plans to see the new Coen brothers movie. We may see the movie tomorrow afternoon.</description>

      <description>My family in Texas recently sat through yet another hurricane. This time it was Ike, and it was a direct hit to Galveston and Houston. Luckily, my Houston (Katy) peeps went unscathed and those in Nederland/Port Neches had only minor damage to their houses. They were lucky because if the storm surge had been much higher, they would have had flood damage in addition to the wind damage.
On a related note, the streaking Astros were forced to play two “home” games against the Cubs just 90 miles from Chicago in Milwaukee.</description>

The device holds 2 750gb drives which are mirrored for constant data redundancy. In addition, it runs an embedded version of Linux and can do pretty much anything a Linux computer can do. There’s an active user and developer community for help with every aspect of the system, including extending it and customizing it.</description>

I would like to de-emphasize the blogging portion of the site and instead create something more like a portal. I use quite a few web sites that provide activity feeds (Facebook, Delicious, Amazon, Netflix, Last.fm, and Flickr to name a few). Since I rarely blog anything of interest, I’m thinking that the main content on cleverswine.</description>

      <description>If anyone is wondering why they can’t find our wedding web site via this page, it’s because I purposely do not link to it from this page. If I were to put a link to that web site from here, the search engines would crawl and index it, which means that anyone in the world could easily find and visit our private wedding site. As a result, spammers would start posting comments, evil people would know all of our personal details, etc.</description>

      <description>The truth hurts. I’ve been trying to lose weight for 8 months now, and I’ve lost nothing. None of these truths are surprising, yet I’ve ignored almost all of them. I will be pleasantly plump for my wedding.
  You have to exercise more than you think. [I have to do what!?]
  A half-hour walk doesn’t equal a brownie. [Doh!]

      <description>We just got back from watching the Round Rock Express vs. the Portland Beavers. It was a good game! It was tied in the bottom of the 9th, and one of the Beavers hit a home run (almost) and the Express center fielder made an amazing catch over the wall to save the game. Then Reggie Abercombie hit a 3 run homer for the Express in the 11th and Fernando Nieve saved the game in the bottom of the 11th.</description>

      <description>I’ve put my big buys on hold for now. I can’t decide what kind of car I want. I test drove the MINI Cooper and did not like it. It was too small, too noisy, and although the interior was pretty fancy, it felt cheap. As for the BMW and Audi, I can’t see spending $40k on a car when I can get one that works just as well for $20k.</description>

      <description>I know it’s lame to duplicate a blog post from someone else, but I must quote what I saw on Jason Kottke’s web site today. I guess I’m one of the 5k at the moment.
 Some days, the web feels like 5 people trying to make something; 5k people turning it into a list; and 500MM people saying, “FAIL.”

      <description>I’ve got a couple of expensive items in my mental shopping cart.
My car is 8+ years old now, so I’m thinking it’s time for a new one. Since Bren has an SUV, I’m thinking small. Mini, in fact. Among the list of potential cars, the MINI Cooper S is currently at the top of the list. Also on the list is the Toyota Prius, Audi TT, and BMW 135i. The Audi and BMW are probably out because I can’t stand the thought of spending that much on an automobile.</description>

      <description>Since my favorite MLB baseball team is doing so badly this year, I’ve started to lose interest in watching professional baseball. It’s not fun to watch your team lose. As a result, I’ve brainstormed some ideas to make the game better.
The season is too long! 162 regular season games per team is just too much. Sure, it makes for better statistics, but modern man/woman doesn’t have the attention span for it anymore.</description>

It’s 98 degrees in Gresham right now.
My contracting job is almost up, and we banged out this web site in 6 weeks: http://www.xrankcelebrity5.com/. There’s a good chance that I will stay and work full time for this company (Avenue A | Razorfish).
Bren is having her wedding dress altered today, or something like that.</description>

      <description>So I’ve been using FriendFeed for a few months now. It basically aggregates my online activity (mostly via “social” networks like Facebook and Flickr) and then provides a feed for anyone to consume. It’s not a bad idea, but it’s really too bad that we need something like this. I think it’s a sign that the social web is out of control. Anyway, I find it useful to track what my friends are doing on the web, since we have similar interests.</description>

      <description>We watched Lars and the Real Girl last night. It’s one of the best movies I’ve seen in a while, right up there with other popular independents like Juno and Little Miss Sunshine. It’s billed as a comedy, but it was actually a moving drama with a comedic base. I almost cried, which means that the movie was very well written and directed – especially considering that the co-star is an inflatable sex doll.</description>

The author has written a letter to his 3 year old son, giving him advice on being happy in life’s journey. Note all of the positive comments that follow the post. I wouldn’t suggest that web nerds make a habit of this, as it would cease to be special, but it’s a nice break from the mundane “how-to” articles.</description>

Example:
 At the main library downtown, waiting for a computer, a guy (mid-to-late 30’s) shamelessly (and embarassingly) attempting to flirt with an 18 year-old PSU freshman (who says her R’s like W’s):</description>

Q. How did the programmer die in the shower?
A. He read the shampoo bottle instructions: Lather. Rinse. Repeat.
 Programming is like sex: One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. All programmers are playwrights, and all computers are lousy actors.

      <description>Centennial High School has dropped its ban on eyebrow shaving… that’s right, the kids are shaving their eyebrows. I guess there’s a trend in which kids shave designs into their brows. Unfortunately, a well known East Multnomah County gang does the same, which caused a bit of confusion and concern in this particular high school. I remember back when I was in school. It was the eighties, and the more over the top you could be, the better.</description>

      <description>Just in case someone doesn’t already know, Portland is awesome. Some of our local techies and bloggers have started a new web site where various citizens of P-town can express why they think our city is cool. I was wondering if they would get enough authors to make it worthwhile, but sure enough the articles keep on coming.
If you are interested at all in the culture and general environment of Portland, I would recommend reading PortlandIsAwesome.</description>

Today I came across an unusual story… well, unusual to those of us in the North. A man in Brazoria was routinely pulled over for making an illegal u-turn. The police found a 6 foot alligator and a water moccasin in his car, both alive.</description>

      <description>Weather is generally a boring topic, but 2008 has proven to be much less than boring. Northwest Oregon has seen late snow, followed by the expected sunny and warm days. Now, the snow is returning! Forecasts predict that the snow level will lower to 500 feet again this weekend. What’s going on? I bet Al Gore is confused…

      <description>While considering the fun of programming today, I came up with a new mantra: “Software development should be like a mullet – business in the front, party in the back.”
Today’s biggest buzzword in the industry is “software as a service”. I propose that we toss that idea, and instead standardize on “software as a mullet”. The new approach will focus on having fun during the software lifecycle, while producing business approved results.</description>

      <description>From the Beaumont Enterprise (in Texas, where I grew up):
 West Brook High School administrators on Wednesday defended a black-male-only mentoring session that has prompted a recent inquiry by the American Civil Liberties Union.
 So, this high school in Beaumont decides to call an assembly of students to address issues such as education, test scores, crime, family and gangs. Good for them, except… they only invited black males! Now the ACLU is mad, and the school district is puzzled.</description>

      <description>Hmmm, the Google App Engine is all over the “blogosphere” today. I first read about Google’s new service yesterday, so I promptly signed up to be a beta tester. Today, I was invited to join 10,0000 other programmers to give the App Engine a trial run.
The App Engine is being greeted with mixed feelings by the developer community. Personally, after reading the documentation and API, I can’t think of a good reason to use it.</description>

      <description>According to the article, Top 10 Traits of a Rockstar Software Engineer, I might be a Rockstar Software Engineer. Yay. Here’s the list, with comments about myself.
  Loves To Code (I do)
  Gets Things Done (I mostly do)
  Continuously Refactors Code (I do)
  Uses Design Patterns (I sometimes do)
  Writes Tests (I rarely do…)
  Leverages Existing Code (I do)</description>

      <description>On Friday, Bren wondered into the New Seasons Market in Happy Valley to find the brewer from Ninkasi giving a talk and presentation. She was kind enough to purchase my 3 favorite Ninkasi varieties. Ninkasi is based in Eugene, so I think it’s cool that he came to make an appearance in Happy Valley for the beer-loving Portland area.</description>

      <description>Well, I got fooled left and right yesterday! I guess I am naive…
My favorite embedded device developer, Marcin Juszkiewicz, claimed that he was moving from Poland to London for work. He said that with his new job, he could spend more time in the office and less time taking care of his child. Sounded reasonable to me. He was kidding.
I’m still not clear about this one, but seeing as it was tagged on delicious as “aprilfools”, I’m guessing it wasn’t real.</description>

      <description>I’m generally disappointed with the state of the World Wide Web these days. The WWW used to be a simple communications tool to share information on a globally connected network. I’m not saying that it should have stayed that way, but I wish we had taken a more structured approach to innovation. I’ve written about this before, so I won’t go into it again. My point for today is that Last.</description>

      <description>Okay, it’s not actually April yet, but I’ve always wanted to use the phrase “Sometimes It Snows In April,” which is a Prince song from the movie Under the Cherry Moon. It’s almost April, and snow is in the forecast for tomorrow morning. The forecast tends to change daily, of course, so we’ll see if it really happens. Nonetheless, I am excited by the prospect!</description>

      <description>I’ve been using Vagalume, a last.fm player, on my internet tablet. This might be one of the best and most useful pieces of software that I’ve ever used. I particularly like the neighborhood radio feature, which plays songs from last.fm users that have similar tastes to mine. It’s like having a portable radio that only plays stuff that I like.</description>

      <description>Just a couple of days ago, I was using XMLSpy at work to do some test XSLT transformations. Our XSL templates here at work are pretty complex, with a few xsl:include tags to import common code. After trying for nearly a day to get XMLSpy to render my transformations, I gave up. I tried every available rendering engine, I tried inserting all of the included code into one file, I tried simplifying the XML – all to no avail.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently rediscovered the joy of comic books. Joss Whedon was kind enough to continue the Buffy the Vampire Slayer T.V. series via comic book. Reading the Buffy comic has been just as fulfilling as watching the show. Now, in addition to Buffy, I am reading The Umbrella Academy which is written by Gerard way of My Chemical Romance. I admit, I was unsure about reading a comic written by a rock star, but so far it is really good.</description>

      <description>I would not normally advocate Wal-Mart, as they are evil in so many ways, but I’ve been reading the Wal-Mart blog lately. It’s called Check Out. I don’t know exactly who the “associates” are that write on this blog, but it does bring a human side to the company. Obviously, it’s a marketing ploy, but I still enjoy reading it. It is G rated and censored (no foul language allowed), like the store.</description>

      <description>My tiny Southeast Texas home of Nederland was recently host to Hillary Clinton, Ted Danson, and Mary Steenburgen. 600 people showed up for Hillary’s campaign propaganda. I’d say she’s being pretty thorough to make a stop in Nederland. Maybe that’s how she won Texas. So strange. Meanwhile, Forest Whitaker was in nearby Beaumont doing his thing for Obama.</description>

Our name was entered at the Bridal Show, so we were pretty sure that it was a legitimate prize. The only catch was that we had to sit through a 90 minute presentation about fancy cookware. We went to the presentation last night at the Hayden Island Holiday Inn Express.</description>

      <description>I’ve decided that I want a nutria for a pet (or nutra-rat, as it’s called in Texas and Louisiana). I didn’t think we had nutria up here in Oregon, but I was wrong. Apparently there’s a “nutria pond” in Gresham, on the Springwater Trail. Unfortunately, for the nutria, people are being encouraged not to feed them and to have them captured and killed. I guess they are quite the nuisance, digging holes and eating up vegetation and kicking out native animals.</description>

Meanwhile, my home state of Texas, which is primarily Republican, seems to be shifting towards Obama. Now they know how us Democrats feel when we have no one decent to vote for.</description>

I must be old, because as I scan through the list, I keep saying “oh yeah, I’ve done that.” Here are some examples of how old I am… Rabbit ears. PASCAL. Dialing a rotary phone. Formatting a floppy. Putting a needle on a vinyl record. Rewinding VCR tapes.</description>

      <description>I’ve been working unusually hard lately, and by “working” I mean sitting in front of computers solving complex problems. Coincidentally, I’ve lost a couple of pounds this week. Now I’m wondering if thinking burns calories. Am I burning calories by thinking about the possibility of thinking burning calories? The brain is an amazing machine! Now, if only I could upgrade my processor and memory, and rewire a few circuits.</description>

      <description>Have I mentioned that The Viewpoint Inn (the location of our wedding) has chickens? They have their own chicken house at the back of the Inn. We were assured that these particular chickens, who have names, are not used in the kitchen.

      <description>We saw There Will Be Blood last night. It was really good, except we’re not completely sure what it was about. Was it about capitalism, family, greed, religion, or some combination? It may have been helpful to read Upton Sinclair’s Oil! first, but neither of us have. The movie was based on the book. Despite the lost meaning, it was a captivating and memorable movie. I had nightmares featuring Mr. Plainview last night.</description>

      <title>Why is Bird Poop White?</title>

      <description>I was admiring the site of a beautiful seagull flying peacefully through downtown, when it suddenly dropped some poop in mid-flight. I watched the white poop fall from the bird to the ground. Then I got to thinking, why is bird poop white? A quick web search led me to Yahoo Answers. It turns out that birds don’t urinate. They have one multipurpose hole for pee, poo, sex, and birth. Here’s the detailed explanation.</description>

      <description>When I was a teenager, I collected locks of hair from all of my female friends and girlfriends. I must have had 30 clumps of hair, each tied neatly with a piece of ribbon. At the time, I thought there was nothing strange about it. In retrospect, however, it seems a bit psycho. I mention this because I just read an article about this year’s President’s Day.
 For the first time, The Academy of Natural Sciences is displaying a scrapbook that has locks of hair from the first 12 U.</description>

      <description>I’ve been on a diet since January 1st of this year. So far I’ve gained 1.5 pounds (as seen in the graph above). It’s time for a new approach. I’m thinking that a tad bit of exercise might help, but then who has the time or motivation for that? Not I. I will just have to eat less and quit snacking. I wrote a cool Rails app and everything to track my weight loss (which has become weight gain).</description>

      <description>We went back to the Viewpoint Inn today to take care of some wedding business. As luck would have it, today was a beautiful, mostly clear day. As luck would not have it, we didn’t bring a real camera. As luck would have it, my cell phone has a camera on it. I took a handful of photos and added them to flickr.
This is my favorite photo from today’s trip.</description>

      <description>It’s my fourth day in IBM Websphere training. I’m becoming an expert with Process Server (cough cough). It’s been a long time since I’ve been in a training class that really challenges me. As an old school procedural programmer, it’s a bit mind-blowing to design processes visually. I’m a proponent of simple, straight-forward software design – which Process Server is not. I’m not knocking Process Server, it’s actually quite a cool tool.</description>

      <description>While reading my daily dose of the Data Portability mailing list, I uncovered an interesting idea that could solve a problem that I’ve been thinking about for a long time. That problem would be the inability to share personal address books (PAB) across multiple computers. The project is called CardDAV. Think of it as IMAP for email, or WebDAV for files. So far, it’s just an idea. I certainly hope the idea becomes a specification and is adopted by the major address book applications.</description>

      <description>A friend just told me about FriendFeed, which is sort of a social web aggregater. Rather than try to explain it, here’s what they say about themselves:
 Our goal is to make content on the Web more useful and discoverable by taking advantage of your social connections. FriendFeed is a simple tool that scratches the surface of that goal by making it easier to keep track of the web pages, videos, music, and photos your friends and family interact with around the Internet.</description>

      <description>I sort of learned a new word today: couture. As I was browsing the news, I came across a J.Lo article which warranted my attention (because J.Lo is… super cool). The title of the article is “Even J.Lo’s hospital gowns have to be couture.” I had no idea what that meant, so I looked up couture on dictionary.com. I still don’t know what it means. Perhaps she needs designer gowns in the hospital?</description>

      <description>We got a bit of snow last night in Gresham. I’d say there was about 1.5″ when I left for work this morning, and I think it’s supposed to snow some more throughout the day. In downtown Portland, there’s pretty much nothing. I should have worked from home today so I could have played in the snow.</description>

      <description>There’s not a whole lot to report since my last update, but here goes. Bren (and her friends) has started looking at wedding dresses. Apparently she has found at least a couple that she really likes. I have no idea what they look like, as I’m following the traditional superstition rules. Meanwhile, I’m still working away on the reception music play list. The location (Viewpoint Inn) has changed what I had in mind for the music.</description>

      <description>There is a large construction site just outside of my building at work. The banging of the machines is insanely loud. It’s tolerable from within the building, but when I walk outside, my eardrums are greeted with earthshaking (literally) noise. They are apparently building a new office high rise, right in front of the police building. Surely the employees there are angry because their view of the river and Mt.

      <description>I just finish developing another weight loss application with Ruby on Rails. For the most part, it’s nothing noteworthy – just your standard Rails MVC project with simple views. The one tiny noteworthy thing is that I made use of the Google Chart API for charting the progress of one’s diet. I wouldn’t call it an API… it’s more like a URL query string specification. Anyway, I created a model attribute to mine one’s weigh-in history and produce a query string for the Google Chart API URL.</description>

      <description>We were seriously considering the Abernathy Center after our visit today. But, we had also scheduled an appointment at the Viewpoint Inn, located in the Columbia River Gorge, near the Vista House. As we wound our way up the road, the rain changed into snow. As many of you know, I get very excited about snow. I jokingly quipped to Bren that this was a sign that we had found our wedding site.</description>

      <description>Location
We’ll be looking at two potential wedding locations this weekend. Our preference is for an outdoor ceremony, so that’s where we are starting. First, we’ll be looking at the Abernathy Center in Oregon City. We like the photos we’ve seen. There are lots of gardens and gazebos and we would have the reception outdoors under a large tent. Second, we’ll be looking at Viewpoint Inn in Corbett. This place is really nice and upscale, and has a fabulous view.</description>

      <description>I had a brilliant idea. Since I work in downtown Portland, and frequently take walks around the city, I thought I’d take photos of interesting things and post them here. I was going to start today during lunch, but it’s way too friggin’ cold out there. I had to speed walk back to the heated office. I did get a decent shot of the parking garage that I park in. Woo hoo.</description>

      <description>We just finished watching the Six Feet Under complete series box set. What a great show that was! I was a little unsure about the ending, but now that I’ve had time to absorb it, I think it’s brilliant. For those who don’t know, the show was an HBO series about a family that runs and lives in a funeral home. The character development is wonderful, and the shooting style is similar to that of American Beauty (same writer/director).</description>

I laid down on the floor and got into a position that was comfortable. When I was ready to get up, it wasn’t happening. It took me a good 30 minutes of screaming to finally stand up. Bren suggested that I go to the emergency room, which I was at first opposed to.</description>

      <description>Now that I’m engaged, the obvious next step is to build a web site for the wedding. So far, I’m looking at four choices.
 Brides.com has a free web site builder. The template looks really nice, but it doesn’t seem to be real flexible. TheKnot.com also has a free web site builder. It seems a little basic and inflexible. I could create my own, with a subdomain like wedding.cleverswine.net. I would hate to reinvent the wheel, though.</description>

      <description>Great Olan Mills photos… Total frickin’ awesomeness from Olan Mills, Sears and other fine portrait studios.
This is a must see for anyone that remembers Olan Mills photos from the 70s and 80s!</description>

      <description>I bet Nintendo had no idea that their WII gaming console would make such a splash in nursing homes. Apprently, the WII is all the rage in the elderly world. Some homes have regular tournaments with the sports games. For example, here is an article about a recent bowling tournament.
 When asked to comment on the 202 to 182 stunner, the few other residents who were both awake at the time and able to remember the action agreed that the match was surely one for the record books.</description>

      <description>We saw “Charlie Wilson’s War” this weekend. Although it wouldn’t make the list of my favorite movies of all time, it was very well done. There was never a dull moment and I have no complaints about anything. Philip Seymour Hoffman does an amazing job in the role of Gust Avrakotos. He really should win some kind of award. The historical significance of the story is revealing and unsettling. Go see it.</description>

      <description>I’ve just discovered a hot sauce named after one of my favorite 80s straight edge punk bands, Minor Threat. Pitchfork says it’s so. It sounds delicious!
 Made from a rare, mild breed of habaneros grown specifically for us, Minor Threat draws its inspiration from the legendary West Indies’ mustard- and mango-based habanero sauces, only it mysteriously priviledges the pepper’s fruitiness over its notoriously overwhelming heat.

_The dreary days come and go
And then the dreary days come and go again
Life will never be gentle or kind
Nor will it be important or spectacular
There’s never ending turmoil in my mind
Trying to understand what I can’t
I try my best, but I’ll never win</description>

      <description>Last night, while hanging out and watching TV, we heard a chorus of children’s voices coming from our front yard. Naturally, our initial reaction was one of terror. We slouched down on the couch to hide from the little singing monsters. Then, the doorbell rang. We, of course, did not answer it. After about an hour, when we knew that the monsters were gone, we opened the front door. On the doorstep, we found a Mormon DVD about Jesus Christ.</description>

      <description>I may have found something geeky that Bren and I can have in common. I’m talking about KnitML. KnitML is a new markup language (like html or xml) used to describe knitting patterns. How geeky is that?
 The KnitML Project’s main goal is to develop and promote adoption of a standard content model for knitting patterns. By developing a community-supported specification (KnitML) and providing basic rendering and transformation tools, the KnitML Project aims to make KnitML easy to use and valuable to the knitter.</description>

      <description>I started a new Ruby on Rails project today, and I decided to create the database using migrations. I should have been doing this all along, but I never really understood migrations or what the benefit might be. Well, now I know. In about 10 minutes, I created my Rails migration files, and then I ran “rake db:migrate”. Bam! There was my MySQL database, just as I had planned for it to look.</description>

Story on KATU
In other weather related catastrophe news, the midwest is covered in ice. Bren’s parents are near K.C., Mo., so I’d imagine they are among the frozen. This ice storm appears to be a major incident.</description>

      <description>I’ve always wondered where the term “counting sheep” came from. I’ve tried counting sheep to fall asleep, and it doesn’t work. In my case, the sheep don’t cooperate. Come to find out…
 …counting sheep is actually an inferior means of inducing sleep. Subjects who instead imagined “a beach or a waterfall” were forced to expend more mental energy, and fell asleep faster than those asked to simply count sheep.</description>

Today I discovered that I can use the n800’s bluetooth to connect to my cell phone and transfer files back and forth. I could also use my cell phone for internet connectivity, but I don’t have the network plan from AT�T.</description>

      <description>In the newest issue of NME (a British magazine about new music), there is a cover story on Morrissey. Morrissey and NME have always been at odds, but it has generally been tame. This time, however, rather than just publishing the Morrissey interview as it was done, NME decided to add commentary that totally trashes the man. I’ve not read the article, titled “Has the World Changed, or Has He Changed?</description>

Unfortunately, the writer’s strike will postpone it for a while, but Fox has already agreed to 7 episodes.

I harvested all of them yesterday and we’ve started the process of making hot sauce. It took a while to chop and seed them, and now our hands are stained with fire. We have to be careful what we touch (especially eyes). It would have been wise to wear gloves.</description>

      <description>If you look at my Music page, you’ll see that I’ve added an “album quilt” from my last.fm account. It shows a collage of all the albums that I listen to most frequently. I think this is way cool, but you may not. If you’re not familiar with last.fm, here’s how it works: any time I listen to music, the song information is transmitted to my last.fm account. This way, I can get music recommendations based on what I listen to, I can have my own web radio station, I can show people what I listen to, etc.</description>

      <description>We spent the weekend camping at Lost Lake. First, we stopped by the Bonneville Dam Fish Hatchery to check out some giant sturgeon. Then, we got lost on the way to Lost Lake. We were on a gravel road somewhere on the mountain for almost two hours. We finally re-found civilization and made our way to the campground. The weather was decent, but chilly and cloudy. We did some hiking and stuff.</description>

      <description>My family down in Texas survived Humberto. Apparently they lost some trees and thousands of tree limbs. Naturally, they lost electricity as well. The eye of the storm passed directly over my parents’ house.</description>

      <description>Caring for Your Introvert
This is an interesting article about introverts and how to deal with them. I wonder why I’d post about such a subject? My favorite part is:
 How can I let the introvert in my life know that I support him and respect his choice?
First, recognize that it’s not a choice. It’s not a lifestyle. It’s an orientation.
Second, when you see an introvert lost in thought, don’t say “What’s the matter?</description>

      <description>Yesterday we took a bike ride down the Springwater Trail in search of blackberries. Unfortunately it’s the end of the season and most of the reachable berries had been picked over. We ended up getting a small bowl full, which we intend to put on cheesecake.</description>

      <description>So the new tablet pc comes with a screenshot program that automatically takes a screenshot and uploads it to flickr.com. That is sooo cool! So far this gadget is perfect. Another suprising feature is that it works perfectly with Orb.com, which means I can watch TV and view all of the multimedia stored on my home server.</description>

      <description>Today, we went to the Huckleberry Festival up near Mt Hood. It was disappointing, but we did get a delicious huckleberry shortcake and a huckleberry shake. After that, we took a hike on the nearby Old Salmon River Trail. Finally, we saw Superbad. I saw it as the current generation’s “Fast Times…”. Bren wasn’t quite that impressed, but liked it.</description>

      <description>I enhanced my code library application by applying an Ext JS front end to it. The coolest part is the tree on the left. You can drag/drop code and categories to rearrange them and the changes are saved asynchronously to the database via ajax. I’m hoping that it’s user-friendly enough that I’ll start using it as a code sample repository.</description>

      <description>I finally got upgraded to Windows XP at work. I was using Windows 2000 until now. I am currently reinstalling all of my development tools, giving me time to write on my web site (and clean up my desk). My reason for making an “urgent” request for Windows XP is that it has remote desktop capability built in. With this, I can VPN to work and then remote to my desktop.</description>

      <description>The Portland Ikea finally opened last week. We went and we shopped, but not on opening day. We actually didn’t buy all that much. I got a new desk chair that is very mod looking. The couch that we’ve been wanting for months has been disconinued and they had nothing else close enough to it. That was quite disappointing. For now we’re stuck with my $80 Goodwill couch from the 70s.</description>

      <description>I thought I would be able to make it through Mamma Mia, given that I’m a big fan of Abba music. On the contrary, those were some of the worst 2.5 hours that I’ve experienced. The music was fine, but the play itself was boring and intolerable. I had leave at one point because I was squirming out of my uncomfortable chair. Unless you’re a musical junkie, don’t see this. Bren was able to tolerate it, but then she is a musical junkie.</description>

      <description>We saw Hairspray last night, which is the movie version of the Broadway musical which is based on a movie by John Waters. I was pleased to see a cameo by John Waters at the beginning, as I am a fan of his. The movie was pretty good, and does the original justice. If you can tolerate a musical I’d recommend it.
Tonight we are going to see Mama Mia, which is a musical play featuring music from Abba.</description>

Without this application, users of Matchbox (on a PDA anyway) must edit a series of configuration files in order to create folders and move programs from folder to folder. My program allows for adding/editing/deleting applications and folders. It’s written in Python 2.4 using the GTK library for UI.</description>

iPhone:
Pros: It looks nice and does lots of cool stuff (I assume). There will be a large software repository due to it’s popularity.
Cons: It’s Apple. I don’t want a machine so tightly coupled with a corporation.</description>

      <description>I decided that my car is old enough to put stickers on it. I’ve had a pile of Morrissey and Smiths stickers in storage for years (like, about 10-15 years). I put a couple of the Smiths ones on my rear window, along with an Astros sticker that I just purchased. I’ll probably leave it at that because it looks tastefully done. I saw a great bumper sticker yesterday, which read “Bumper Sticker”.</description>

It serves up files for my other computers, but it still sits there idle 99% of the time. I thought about having it download illegal media with bit torrent, but that can lead to headaches (viruses, etc).</description>

You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.
You like coding at a High level.
The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.</description>

      <description>I removed Windows Vista on my main desktop computer and installed Ubuntu Linux. It’s been a while since I’ve used linux, and I see it has improved a bit. So far everything is working, and I have all the software I could ever need.

Also, I bought a mini computer to hook up to the LCD television. It’s by a comany called Enano. The entire computer is about the size of a CD drive.</description>

 I can hack the WordPress theme stylesheets IE6 users can upgrade their web browser  Since option 1 isn’t really an option, here are links to the latest and greatest web browsers (they are free, so you should get one):</description>

      <description>After months of looking and waiting, Bren came across a Nintendo Wii yesterday! I guess Nintendo finally caught up with the demand. The last gaming console that I’ve owned was an Intellivision II, back in the 80s. I’ve been waiting for the right system to come along, as I’m not impressed (or good at) the modern genre of games. So far the Wii has not disappointed. We only have Wii Sports, which came bundled, but it will take a while to get tired of that.</description>

2007: Jeffrey given huge doses of Ritalin. Becomes a zombie. School gets extra money from state because Jeffrey has a disability.

      <description>We went bowling on Saturday at the newly renovated Mt. Hood Lanes in Gresham. I did surprisingly well, with scores of 172 and 190. I think it was the lack of pressure, since it wasn’t a league situation. Unfortunately, I took no photos.
On Sunday, we went to the Gresham Earth Day celebration at City Hall. There wasn’t a whole lot there, and it was mostly for kids, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.</description>

      <description>According to Business Week’s “World’s Top 100 Most Livable Cities”, Portland is the 46th most livable city in the world. I’d say that’s quite impressive considering that there are only 8 U.S. cities in the top 50. It looks like Switzerland is really the place to be.

There are plenty of community code snippet sites out there, but I found that I needed my own personal collection of code since I know what I’m likely to need. When I first started this project, I heard about Ext JS, which is a toolkit for Ajax and UI components.</description>

There are cities on the list that I’ve never even heard of – but no Portland. His last show here was a huge success, and I know he has a loyal following here. My only theory is that Morrissey is trying to avoid Johnny Marr, who is currently calling Portland home.</description>

 Convergence is an annual gothic-industrial festival, now in its 13th year. It is a chance for many goths and others who normally only meet on the Internet to come together in real life. Convergence is held in North America, in a different location each year voted on by previous attendees.

      <description>I’m going to start posting songs on occasion. As much as I listen to music, I occasionally come across a song that really moves me and I want to share it. Plus, delicious has this cool inline player script (click on the play arrow).

      <description>This is a song that I wrote years ago. I now have a real keyboard, so I’m hoping to become inspired soon to really learn how to play and write real music. For now this is all I have to offer.

      <description>Tonight is the 2 year anniversary party for local organic brewer, Roots. I can attest to their popularity, as restaurants all the way out in Gresham carry their beer on tap. I’ve been enjoying the fine products of Roots since they began 2 years ago. In the words of Willie Week:
 “With more than three dozen breweries prospering in the city, itâ€™s hard to believe that Roots Organic Brewing has only been on the market for two years.</description>

A Conversation at the Grownup Table, as Imagined at the Kidsâ€™ Table
MOM: Pass the wine, please. I want to become crazy.
DAD: O.K.
GRANDMOTHER: Did you see the politics? It made me angry.
DAD: Me, too. When it was over, I had sex.
UNCLE: Iâ€™m having sex right now.
DAD: We all are.
MOM: Letâ€™s talk about which kid I like the best.</description>

      <description>It’s time again for March Madness (NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament). I’m usually neutral about who wins, but this year I’ve got 3 teams on my radar: Oregon, Texas, and Texas A�M. I’m not counting on any of those teams to win the whole thing, but it’s fun to root for them. I’m watching the Winthrop vs. Oregon game as I type…</description>

      <description>After seven fabulous seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, writer Joss Whedon has begun work on season eight – in comic book form. The comic is being published by local company Dark Horse Comics. I have already pre-ordered the first 3 issues, plus issue #1 with an alternate cover. I’d rather continue to see Buffy as a television show, but a comic will do.
Update, March 16: Buffy: Season 8 #1 sells out – gets second printing!</description>

      <description>We went to see 300 this weekend. I had great expectations after watching the trailers and reading the reviews. The battle scenes were some of the coolest movie scenes that I’ve experienced. As most reviews point out, they were very video-game-like, and very bloody. Unfortunately, outside of the battle scenes, there wasn’t much substance. We’re not given a lot of detail about the history of the Persians and Spartans, and why they are battling at the moment.</description>

      <description>I finally got a photo of Chester eating from my hand. He’s getting braver by the day. I think he saw me in the kitchen this morning, because he was on the back patio waiting for a peanut.</description>

      <description>Chester is a squirrelthat lives in our back yard. He loves peanuts. We like to give him peanuts. He quickly learned that the humans in the big wooden boxhave the goods. Now when we step outside, Chester cautiously creeps towards us with his mind on the next free peanut. Each time, he becomes less and less cautious. At this point, he will take the peanut from my hand. He’s still pretty jumpy, but hopefully he’ll figure out that we’re ok.</description>

      <description>I created a somewhat exhaustive list of software that I use (see Pages on the right). I did this for 2 reasons: one, it’s a convenient place for me to go if I need to reinstall any or all of my software, and two, it may be helpful to others. If there’s something that you think I left off of the list, add it as a comment to this post. Gracias.</description>

      <description>I’ve never wanted a cell phone with a camera on it because I’m all about separation of functionality. I want a camera that works well, a phone that works well, a calculator that works well, etc etc. When you start combining unrelated functionality into one “gadget”, you lose quality in the individual pieces. However, these days it’s nearly impossible to get a decent phone without a camera built in, so now I have one.</description>

      <description>This web site has changed again! The content is exactly the same, but I’m messing around with the look and feel. The experience of trying to create my own style sheet from scratch has reinforced the truth about my lack of creativity. In the end, as you can see, I chose the WordPress default theme because it’s actually better than anything I could come up with! Alas, I am a programmer, not a web designer.</description>

      <description>I sold my 17″ widescreen laptop because it was too large and heavy to carry around. After much research, I bought the Acer Ferrari ultraportable 12.1″ laptop as a replacement. It weighs in at 3.5 lbs. I’ve got Windows Vista running on it, and so far it has been worth the high price tag.
Here is an article about it.</description>

      <description>I have 2 fairly new toys that are exciting enough (to me) to write about. One is a 37″ LCD television from Olevia. I got a great deal on it, and we are very happy with it. Unfortunately, we don’t have HD service yet. Soon. The other toy is a mouse for my PDA. The mouse itself isn’t that impressive, but it gives my PDA a laptop feel. I’m currently running Linux with ICEWM as the window manager.</description>

      <description>Work has kept me busy and tired, hence the lack of updates…
I’m taking a small vacation to Seattle this weekend. We’ll be seeing the Red Sox vs. Mariners on Sunday, and then we’re going to Ikea on Monday. Before we take off to Seattle, we’re going to see Bill Maher here in P-town.
I saw something disturbing yesterday: there are some crazy people that think the current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is a sign of the second coming of Christ, and they are happy about it.</description>

      <description>In experimenting with the GTK widget set (an open source, cross platform user interface library), I’ve produced this little application to search Amazon.com for movie titles. The movies can be saved locally and be printed to make DVD covers, etc. It’s not finished yet. Ruby is the language I’ve chosen for this development.</description>

      <description>I’m no longer using Netflix since I now have Directv with more channels than I know what to do with (including the MLB channels so I can watch the Astros make their way to the World Series again). I replaced the movie section of this page (below, to the right) with a music section, “I’m listening to…”. Here I will link to the artist site and provide 1 full song for download.</description>

      <description>Kohl’shad a grand opening sale today in Gresham. I’ve never been to a Kohl’s before and now I know where I’ll be buying most of my clothing. Their stuff is insanely cheap, and high quality (brand names). Today, I bought 15 pairs of black socks for about $18 total! I’ll be disposing of my current inventory of socks and I’ll never have to match them up again – because my 15 pairs are all exactly the same!</description>

      <description>I had my teeth cleaned today, for the first time in… a while. I stand by my theory that the number of visits to the dentist is proportional to the number of tooth problems one has (the theory is not unfounded).

      <description>We are all popsicles in Portland. Not only is it freezing, but the winds are blowing “pretty good”.</description>

      <description>We got a little bit of snow in Lake Oswego last night, and more is forecast for this weekend. I guess spring isn’t quite here yet.</description>

      <description>We took some old computer hardware to Free Geektoday. Bren had an old school Tandy and a dot matrix printer stored away in the closet. I meant to take photos, in case the computer museum needed them, but I forgot. Meanwhile, I received a fabulous Valentine’s Day present today (early, I know) – a Creative Zen Micro 6gb mp3 player! Very nice, very nice. And if that isn’t enough, we just ate stuffed bellpeppers made with fake ground meat.</description>

      <description>I’m thinking that I’ll look more like Drew Carey when I get my new glasses. I’d never wear a suit, of course.</description>

      <description>I went to the optometrist today and ordered new glasses, similar to the ones pictured here (but not quite as extreme). My eyes were proclaimed healthy and they have only slightly degraded over the past 4 years (the last time I saw the optometrist).</description>

      <title>I like WordPress</title>

      <description>The longer I use WordPress, the more I like it. It has quite a few features, but they don’t get in the way of simplicity. I’m finding it easy to add content, pages, and links, all “willy-nilly”. Customizing the appearance isn’t that difficult if you’re familiar with CSS and/or PHP. There are also “plugins” galore, such as these. A good experience so far.
I might also mention thatÂ a2web hosting has been phenomenal so far.</description>

      <description>It’s all new. I’m giving WordPress a test run. So far, it’s nice, but I’m guessing that I’ll eventually ditch it and create my own. It’s too complex for my needs, and I’d like to have full control of the application. My new hosting service, a2 hosting, supports Ruby/Rails.</description>
