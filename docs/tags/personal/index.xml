      <description>We are getting a cat today! Sly and Cordy have been gone for 2-3 years now, and we&amp;#8217;ve been talking about getting more cats for a while. Brenda found a good one at the Troutdale humane society yesterday. She&amp;#8217;s 6 months old and had just arrived at the shelter. Lots of photos coming soon&amp;#8230;

[Edit] Her name is Olivia.</description>

      <description>Our new deck is complete and it&amp;#8217;s much nicer than the old one. The flooring is composite material from TimberTech and the railing is aluminum. We plan to stain the wood skirting to better match the deck and house color, but we&amp;#8217;ll have to wait until it stops raining. As a bonus, we have a decent sized storage area underneath part of the deck.</description>

      <description>We built a small raised vegetable garden this year in one of the only spots in our yard that gets more than 4 hours of sunshine. It happens to be next to the driveway, but that&amp;#8217;s okay.</description>

This summer is getting off to a slow start, as are our vegetables. We planted tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, various peppers, and carrots. So far we haven&amp;#8217;t picked a thing. We&amp;#8217;ve barely reached the 80s in temperature, and we&amp;#8217;ve had more rain than usual. However, despite the lack of veggies, I&amp;#8217;m personally enjoying the cool summer.</description>

      <description>We did this week&amp;#8217;s grocery shopping at Food Front in the Hillsdale neighborhood. They carry many local and organic food products. And, it may be my imagination, but local eggs fresh from the chicken taste so much better than the mass produced commercial eggs.</description>

      <description>Spring was here for a few days, but the cool, wet weather is returning this week. We planted some veggies in the few spots where we get sunlight. Hopefully we&amp;#8217;ll get something out of them.</description>

      <description>After a few weeks of shopping in and around Portland, we finally landed some nice office furniture at a reasonable price. City Liquidators turns out to be the place for furniture (and other things ranging from tampons to sofas). Next up, we&amp;#8217;ll be painting the room.</description>

      <description>For my birthday, I went to Rogue (as I have done for the past 7 years in a row) and got a free beer and t-shirt. Bren and I took the next day off of work and had a delicious meal at Salvador Molly&amp;#8217;s and took a hike around Gabriel Park. It was a fantastic birthday. Now that I&amp;#8217;m in my &amp;#8220;late 30s&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;, I may choose to do something different next year.</description>

      <description>[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleverswine/4126822232/sizes/l/)New Couch We got our new couch from JCPenney last weekend. We weren&amp;#8217;t expecting it until mid-December because we had custom fabric put on it. We&amp;#8217;re glad to have it for Thanksgiving because we&amp;#8217;re having company over for food and games. I think the red (berry) fabric was a good choice, as it adds some color to the room and it matches the chair we recently purchased. The rug is new as well.</description>

      <description>We moved in to our new house Friday. I don&amp;#8217;t have many photos yet because we are still unpacking. So far, almost everything has gone well. DirecTV is unwilling to get on our roof to install the satellite dish. Apparently, it is unsafe. We&amp;#8217;ve asked for a second opinion from another installer, so we&amp;#8217;ll see. Other than that, all is good!
Some photos are here, with more to come as we get settled in.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8230;this web site is way out of date. I&amp;#8217;m working on a replacement that is less of a blog and more of an aggregator. It&amp;#8217;s slow going due to my lack of free time lately, but it will be here one day. Meanwhile, try the links in the header for more up to date Kevin data.
What&amp;#8217;s going on? We&amp;#8217;re attempting to sell our house and move closer in to Portland.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re heading over to the Spring Beer &amp;#038; Wine Festival this afternoon. I prefer the spring event because it&amp;#8217;s indoors and much less crowded than the summer or winter ones. Walking Man brewery has a couple of interestingly named beers at the fest: Streetwalker Malt Liquor and Big Black Homo. I may have to try them based on the names alone.</description>

      <description>In my first full week of using Weight Watchers Online, I lost 2 pounds. I pretty much hit my weekly point allowance exactly. My goal this week is to end up 5 points below my allowance.
As for my review of the online experience, I&amp;#8217;d say it&amp;#8217;s a little better than a spreadsheet. Granted, there are features that I don&amp;#8217;t use yet like forums and recipe searches. Still, the fact that I&amp;#8217;m paying a monthly fee helps with motivation.</description>

I had success with them about 5 years ago when I got skinny and stayed that way until I met my wife. Something about being married makes one forget to be healthy. I had actually written my own Weight Watchers type web application a couple of years ago, but I didn&amp;#8217;t use it well. Now that I&amp;#8217;m paying $17 a month, I think I&amp;#8217;ll stick to the plan.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently been thinking about how I can improve my job search tactics. There are tons of web sites out there with great advice for job seekers, and some things are just obvious. I&amp;#8217;ve decided to jot down some random, and not so random, thoughts of my own about the process (with a focus on the tech industry).

Where to find job openings&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;ve actually found the most promising job opportunities on Craigslist.</description>

      <description>2009 is upon us. We as a country have a lot of improvements to make this year. I, as an individual, don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of change in mind. My only big resolution is to lose some weight and get back into shape. I&amp;#8217;ve let myself go since meeting Bren. I feel bad for her, because she thought she was getting involved with a lean, mean, programming machine. Now, I&amp;#8217;m an unemployed fat slob (okay, that may be an exaggeration).</description>

I also just installed DropBox because I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to find a way to create offsite copies of some of our important files.&amp;#160; I haven&amp;#8217;t tried it yet, but I hear good things about it.
Hmm, now that I&amp;#8217;m about to publish, I&amp;#8217;m wondering if it will handle WordPress tags&amp;#8230; it did not.</description>

      <description>Tonight we bought and installed an over the stove microwave oven. The most impressive part (or, the part that I&amp;#8217;m proudest of) is that we wired up and installed a new electrical outlet. There was an old (70s) vent hood above the stove, and we severed the cord and rewired it to an outlet. All in all, it was a lot of work, and I&amp;#8217;d be inclined to pay someone next time.</description>

I haven&amp;#8217;t seen much of the city yet, but my first impression is that it&amp;#8217;s big and old (old != bad). I&amp;#8217;m staying about .75 miles from the office, so I might walk back to the hotel this evening and check things out on the way. I probably won&amp;#8217;t get out much while I&amp;#8217;m here, but if I do, I&amp;#8217;ll be sure to take photos.</description>

This is a satellite view of the Portland metro area. In the lower right of the map, you can see all of the less populated space. According to rumors, that space will be the next piece of Portland to fall to shopping malls and crowded suburbs. We&amp;#8217;re considering a house where the red dot is (next to Powell Butte).</description>

      <description>Since we&amp;#8217;re searching for a house to buy, I&amp;#8217;ve also been researching various neighborhoods around Portland. I&amp;#8217;ve lived here long enough to be pretty familiar with all of Portland metro, but sometimes hard numbers add a little something. PortlandMaps.com has a decent tool for showing an overview, and details, of crime in Portland. The darker the red, the more crime there was in the past 12 months. I have to say, I&amp;#8217;ve lived in some of the dark red areas (inner SE) and always felt safe.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve started looking seriously at houses to buy. We even have a real estate agent (Leslie, a family of a friend). It&amp;#8217;s supposed to be a buyer&amp;#8217;s market, but I&amp;#8217;ll tell you, houses in Portland are still outrageously priced. I believe I read that the average price here is more than $300k. However, I get the idea that sellers are more than willing to come down quite a bit in price.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a house-like weekend. We started the weekend by continuing our search for a house to buy. We have a couple on the radar, but nothing perfect yet. Today, we inadvertently started rearranging furniture in our house. We&amp;#8217;ve made the living room look much larger and nicer. It was a bit exhausting and we had to cancel our plans to see the new Coen brothers movie. We may see the movie tomorrow afternoon.</description>

      <title>Weight Loss Truths</title>

      <description>The truth hurts. I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to lose weight for 8 months now, and I&amp;#8217;ve lost nothing. None of these truths are surprising, yet I&amp;#8217;ve ignored almost all of them. I will be pleasantly plump for my wedding.
 You have to exercise more than you think. [I have to do what!?]
 A half-hour walk doesn’t equal a brownie. [Doh!]

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve got a couple of expensive items in my mental shopping cart.
My car is 8+ years old now, so I&amp;#8217;m thinking it&amp;#8217;s time for a new one. Since Bren has an SUV, I&amp;#8217;m thinking small. Mini, in fact. Among the list of potential cars, the MINI Cooper S is currently at the top of the list. Also on the list is the Toyota Prius, Audi TT, and BMW 135i. The Audi and BMW are probably out because I can&amp;#8217;t stand the thought of spending that much on an automobile.</description>

      <description>Went mailed off our wedding invitations from Bridal Veil, Oregon today. They have a tiny post office that has come to cater to the postal needs of wedding parties. After dropping off the invitations, we took a small hike around the Bridal Veil waterfall. Photos on flickr.</description>

      <description>From Portland Metblogs:
Why do people feel compelled to take a summer vacation &amp;#8211; when everyone else is doing so &amp;#8211; prices are higher &amp;#8211; it’s hot and sticky and gross outside?

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve written anything here, but I can&amp;#8217;t say that I have anything real interesting to write about&amp;#8230;
It&amp;#8217;s 98 degrees in Gresham right now.
My contracting job is almost up, and we banged out this web site in 6 weeks: http://www.xrankcelebrity5.com/. There&amp;#8217;s a good chance that I will stay and work full time for this company (Avenue A | Razorfish).
Bren is having her wedding dress altered today, or something like that.</description>

      <description>After 8 fruitful years with Portland General Electric, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to give independent software consulting a try. My first gig is at Avenue A | Razorfish. As I really enjoy writing software, this feels like a natural course. I foresee interesting challenges, fun projects, and a chance to co-mingle with the many great minds of Portland. Off I go!</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve just returned from our trip to Texas, where we saw all of my family and visited Galveston, Kemah, and Houston. We had a good time, but it&amp;#8217;s nice to be home in Oregon. The heat and humidity down there was a bit much. On flickr, you will find many photos from the trip.</description>

      <description>On Friday, Bren wondered into the New Seasons Market in Happy Valley to find the brewer from Ninkasi giving a talk and presentation. She was kind enough to purchase my 3 favorite Ninkasi varieties. Ninkasi is based in Eugene, so I think it&amp;#8217;s cool that he came to make an appearance in Happy Valley for the beer-loving Portland area.</description>

      <description>Okay, it&amp;#8217;s not actually April yet, but I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to use the phrase &amp;#8220;Sometimes It Snows In April,&amp;#8221; which is a Prince song from the movie Under the Cherry Moon. It&amp;#8217;s almost April, and snow is in the forecast for tomorrow morning. The forecast tends to change daily, of course, so we&amp;#8217;ll see if it really happens. Nonetheless, I am excited by the prospect!</description>

      <description>We went to Outback Steakhouse last night to celebrate Carol&amp;#8217;s Birthday. Bren spent the whole day working on a card and a gift bag for her. Both turned out to be fabulous. Unfortunately we didn&amp;#8217;t take a photo of her work. We did, however take a couple of photos of the party.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently rediscovered the joy of comic books. Joss Whedon was kind enough to continue the Buffy the Vampire Slayer T.V. series via comic book. Reading the Buffy comic has been just as fulfilling as watching the show. Now, in addition to Buffy, I am reading The Umbrella Academy which is written by Gerard way of My Chemical Romance. I admit, I was unsure about reading a comic written by a rock star, but so far it is really good.</description>

      <description>Now that Bren has a fancy camera (Nikon D40x), I can get good bird photos. I&amp;#8217;ve started a Flickr set for my bird photos here. I hope to get a large variety of Northwest birds into the set this summer.</description>

      <description>We got an exciting call a few days ago. We were told that we had won an all expense paid vacation/honeymoon package to an all inclusive resort in the Bahamas. Our name was entered at the Bridal Show, so we were pretty sure that it was a legitimate prize. The only catch was that we had to sit through a 90 minute presentation about fancy cookware. We went to the presentation last night at the Hayden Island Holiday Inn Express.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve decided that I want a nutria for a pet (or nutra-rat, as it&amp;#8217;s called in Texas and Louisiana). I didn&amp;#8217;t think we had nutria up here in Oregon, but I was wrong. Apparently there&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;nutria pond&amp;#8221; in Gresham, on the Springwater Trail. Unfortunately, for the nutria, people are being encouraged not to feed them and to have them captured and killed. I guess they are quite the nuisance, digging holes and eating up vegetation and kicking out native animals.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve decided to go a few days without shaving, to see what would happen. Unsurprisingly, a beard is sprouting. I have to decide today whether to shave or not. It&amp;#8217;s a tough decision&amp;#8230;</description>
