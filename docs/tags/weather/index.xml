This summer is getting off to a slow start, as are our vegetables. We planted tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, various peppers, and carrots. So far we haven&amp;#8217;t picked a thing. We&amp;#8217;ve barely reached the 80s in temperature, and we&amp;#8217;ve had more rain than usual. However, despite the lack of veggies, I&amp;#8217;m personally enjoying the cool summer.</description>

      <description>Summer came and went. It was a mild summer, but I&amp;#8217;m happy to feel cooler weather.</description>

      <description>Spring was here for a few days, but the cool, wet weather is returning this week. We planted some veggies in the few spots where we get sunlight. Hopefully we&amp;#8217;ll get something out of them.</description>

      <description>The yard,
originally uploaded by cleverswine.
  This is our back yard. I have no idea how many inches we have so far, but I&amp;#8217;d roughly estimate 12&amp;#8243;. It&amp;#8217;s still coming down as of Monday morning. After driving to the MAX station this morning, I&amp;#8217;m ready for the snow to be gone. Driving through it makes me very nervous.

      <title>A Lot Like Christmas</title>

      <description>Like most of the U.S., we&amp;#8217;re getting our fair share of frigid weather in the Northwest. We got some snow on Sunday, and there&amp;#8217;s plenty more to come in the next week. I&amp;#8217;m excited, but I can definitely see why some people don&amp;#8217;t want to live where it snows a lot. For ongoing photos of the Portland area snow storm of 2008, check the flickr pool: Portland Snow Day 2008. Also check mine.</description>

      <title>Felony Flats and Hearses</title>

      <description>This morning I was browsing Weather Underground because there are lots of neat weather related features on that site (almanacs, astrology, maps galore, etc). I was looking through the various Portland weather stations and came across one called &amp;#8220;Felony Flats, Portland, OR&amp;#8220;. I thought that was pretty funny. What&amp;#8217;s funnier is the link to the station&amp;#8217;s web site: Coffin Cruisers Hearse Club of Portland. I had no idea there existed a community of people who drive hearses (and have personal weather stations).</description>

      <title>Ike Messes Things Up</title>

      <description>My family in Texas recently sat through yet another hurricane. This time it was Ike, and it was a direct hit to Galveston and Houston. Luckily, my Houston (Katy) peeps went unscathed and those in Nederland/Port Neches had only minor damage to their houses. They were lucky because if the storm surge had been much higher, they would have had flood damage in addition to the wind damage.
On a related note, the streaking Astros were forced to play two &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221; games against the Cubs just 90 miles from Chicago in Milwaukee.</description>

      <description>From Portland Metblogs:
Why do people feel compelled to take a summer vacation &amp;#8211; when everyone else is doing so &amp;#8211; prices are higher &amp;#8211; it’s hot and sticky and gross outside?

      <title>More on Weather</title>

      <description>Weather is generally a boring topic, but 2008 has proven to be much less than boring. Northwest Oregon has seen late snow, followed by the expected sunny and warm days. Now, the snow is returning! Forecasts predict that the snow level will lower to 500 feet again this weekend. What&amp;#8217;s going on? I bet Al Gore is confused&amp;#8230;

      <description>Today is the first perfect day of the year! It&amp;#8217;s sunny and 70 degrees outside. Bren is working on her gardens, and I&amp;#8217;m geeking out on the laptop. On flickr, you will find some photos of our first Spring outdoor session (taken from my laptop camera).</description>

      <description>After a week of snow, rain, ice, and hail, I think Spring has finally arrived. Today is a beautiful sunny day in Portland.
