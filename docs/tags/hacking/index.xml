      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking for a while about moving my simple web site and blog to a different platform. I&amp;#8217;m currently paying to host everything on a traditional hosting service. Ten years ago, this was really the only option if you wanted buy a domain and put a web site out there (there was also self hosting with dynamic DNS, but I was never brave enough to open up my home network).</description>

      <title>Using cookies with HttpClient</title>
      <link>http://noone.dev/2013/08/06/using-cookies-with-httpclient/</link>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2013/08/06/using-cookies-with-httpclient/</guid>
      <description>This simple code snippet shows how to store and use cookies from a web request using the .Net HttpClient. For example, if an API or site sends a token or authentication cookie, you may need to store it and send it on all subsequent requests to show that you are authenticated. This would be for a session-based service. The key is to create a single CookieContainer instance and a single HttpClientHandler instance to hold it.</description>

      <title>Trying out Windows Live Writer</title>

      <description>Scott Hanselman has been trumpeting Windows Live Writer for some time now. I’ve been hesitant to try it out because I’m a control freak and I was convinced that Live Writer wouldn’t do things correctly. Well, he blogged about it again today so I’m giving it a try (with this post). It was the comments on his post that swayed me.
Live Writer has improved quite a bit since last time I tried it.</description>

      <title>Last.fm Recent Tracks with AngularJS</title>
      <link>http://noone.dev/2013/03/20/last-fm-recent-tracks-with-angularjs/</link>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2013/03/20/last-fm-recent-tracks-with-angularjs/</guid>
      <description>AngularJS is an MVC framework for javascript. It is best suited for round-tripping resources with a RESTful service. In this post, I will simply get a list of recent tracks from Last.fm, treating each track as a resource. The Last.fm API is documented here. There is no round-tripping in this example. I&amp;#8217;ll also be utilizing Twitter Bootstrap for layout.
To start, create the AngularJS application and a controller for recent tracks.</description>

      <title>Thumbnail Gallery with Flickr, Bootstrap, and Javascript</title>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2012/11/01/thumbnail-gallery-with-flickr-bootstrap-and-javascript/</guid>
      <description>I recently created a thumbnail gallery of my latest Flickr photos using the Flickr feeds API, Twitter Bootstrap, and Javascript/jQuery. There is no server side code for this solution, and the client side code is really simple. To start, create a blank html page (I like to start with the HTML5 Boilerplate). Make sure you include the Bootstrap css and jQuery. I used the Thumbnails component of Bootstrap for the gallery layout.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a new Rails application for storing our recipes. It&amp;#8217;s at a point where it is being hosted and used by us. Some of the style is borrowed (stolen) from Martha Stewart&amp;#8217;s blog.
The big feature of La Cocina is it&amp;#8217;s ability to pull in recipes from a number of other recipe sites. I&amp;#8217;m using the nokogiri gem to do screen scraping for recipe data. There&amp;#8217;s an admin interface for creating new screen scrapers (which I call &amp;#8220;scarfers&amp;#8221;), so it&amp;#8217;s easy to add new recipe sites by entering DOM paths (CSS or XPath) and some other options.</description>

      <title>Show SVN revision number in a Rails application</title>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2012/06/07/show-svn-revision-number-in-a-rails-application/</guid>
      <description>This is a hack to display the Subversion revision in a Rails application using Capistrano to insert the current revision number on each deploy.
Create a partial that will contain the revision number. For example, _~/app/views/layouts/revision.html.erb. You can put anything in that file, as it will be overwritten by Capistrano on each deploy. The word &amp;#8220;Development&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Current&amp;#8221; seems a good choice.
In the page where you want to display the revision number (probably in the application layout), render the partial.</description>

      <description>This is an example of how I used the jQuery Automcomplete Widget with Rails 3.2 for a recipe search field. Some of the jQuery stuff mentioned below is included out of the box with a new Rails application.
 Make sure the jQuery gem is referenced in the Gemfile  gem &#39;jquery-rails&#39;  Include the jQuery javascripts in app/assets/javascripts/application.js  //= require jquery //= require jquery_ujs //= require jquery-ui  Download one of the jQuery-ui css files, or a custom one, and put it in one of you asset locations.</description>

      <title>WCF Client and the &amp;#8220;using&amp;#8221; Statement</title>

      <description>As I was researching patterns and practices for a WCF client implementation, I came across a bug in the .Net implementation of ClientBase (whether it&amp;#8217;s actually a bug is arguable). It&amp;#8217;s well documented on the web, but it could cause major headaches if you happened to miss it.
The core of the issue is that ClientBase implements IDisposable. With this knowledge, just about any programmer would naturally wrap its usage in a using{} block.</description>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2011/09/09/findkill-a-linux-process-by-name/</guid>
      <description>I was doing some research to figure out how to easily kill a Linux process given part of it&amp;#8217;s name. It&amp;#8217;s fairly simple to do it manually, but if you didn&amp;#8217;t already know, programmers are lazy.
The first thing I was doing&amp;#8230;
 ps aux | grep Foo
 find the process ID (PID) with my eyes, and then kill it&amp;#8230;
 kill -9 123456
 Next, I started finding complex piped commands to find and extract the PID.</description>

      <title>Simple Moq</title>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2011/04/20/simple-moq/</guid>
      <description>I recently worked on a project in which 90% of its tests were integration tests because the core purpose of the project was to interact with external entities. In an effort create more unit tests, I employed Moq (and lots of refactoring). This is an example of basic Moq usage.
Let&amp;#8217;s say we have a repository that gets documents from a database. The assumption is that a repository interface, IDocumentRepository, is being implemented.</description>

      <title>Complex XSDs as Embedded Resources</title>
      <link>http://noone.dev/2011/03/17/using-complex-xsds-as-embedded-resources/</link>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2011/03/17/using-complex-xsds-as-embedded-resources/</guid>
      <description>I was recently tasked with validating XML files against a very complex set of XSD schema files. This is easily accomplished if your XSD files live on the filesystem, because the .Net xml resolver can find referenced schemas via a relative or absolute Uri. In my case, the schema files were compiled as embedded resources in my project. As expected, the XML schema loader didn&amp;#8217;t know how to find referenced schemas &amp;#8211; it was likely searching for them in the path of the running application.</description>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2011/03/08/mvc3-mongodb-autofac/</guid>
      <description>I recently posted a brief summary of creating a recipe database. I decided to expand on that and go into the implementation details of using ASP.NET MVC3 with MongoDB and Autofac. This code depends on the NoRM driver for MongoDB, Autofac, and MVC3 (and it&amp;#8217;s dependencies). This is by no means the only (or best) way to do things, but this is how I chose to do it. I&amp;#8217;ve simplified the repository to one method for brevity, but you&amp;#8217;d obviously want to add all of the required CRUD operations.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve started on the Paleo Diet, which, of course, means I have to create a software application to go along with it.
I decided this was a good time to give MVC3 and MongoDB a test drive. After diving in, I realized that I could benefit from some dependency injection via MVC3&amp;#8217;s DependencyResolver. I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to learn Autofac, so I threw that in as the container. This was sweet, as it injected my repository implementations into my controllers with very little setup.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m working on What I worked on. Right now it&amp;#8217;s just a basic display of feeds from some of my social networks. I&amp;#8217;d like to fancy it up a bit at some point, perhaps with some nice jQuery tooltips. I&amp;#8217;m using the SimplePie PHP library to fetch the feeds (each one asynchronously). The design is borrowed from Popurls. I know it&amp;#8217;s not that interesting, but it&amp;#8217;s fun for me.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a project to read and update ID3 tags on my music collection. An ID3 tag is the meta data embedded in mp3 files that contains artist and other information. My initial goal is to batch update the &amp;#8220;genre&amp;#8221; field in my mp3 files. I&amp;#8217;ve written a simple .Net forms application to do this. I found a really good library created by Novell called TagLib Sharp. The library makes it super easy to read and write ID3 tags.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been subscribing to Dr. Dobb&amp;#8217;s Journal for at least 10 years. It has always been my favorite technical magazine because of it&amp;#8217;s diversity of topics and brain-stirring articles. I got a letter in the mail last week saying that they were ceasing production of the full magazine. Instead, they will offer a Dr. Dobb&amp;#8217;s Report stuffed into issues of InformationWeek. I&amp;#8217;ll have to spend more time on their web site, as it looks like they have some good content on there.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;#8217;m pretty much stuck in the house due to the snow (and lack of a job), I&amp;#8217;ve decided to learn something new. I&amp;#8217;ve begun writing a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. WPF has some insanely cool UI features, including declarative UI effects. My first project is a simple screensaver that pulls photos from Flickr and displays them as a slideshow with cool transition effects. Eventually, I&amp;#8217;d like to create a dashboard type application that displays news, weather, email, etc.</description>

I also just installed DropBox because I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to find a way to create offsite copies of some of our important files.&amp;#160; I haven&amp;#8217;t tried it yet, but I hear good things about it.
Hmm, now that I&amp;#8217;m about to publish, I&amp;#8217;m wondering if it will handle WordPress tags&amp;#8230; it did not.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve only tested in Firefox 3 and Internet Explorer 7. The font looks a bit strange in IE7&amp;#8230; Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ll be fiddling with it some more over time. Let me know if something doesn&amp;#8217;t look right in your browser.
I know the sidebar isn&amp;#8217;t very elegant (especially the photos/movies/music links). I am soooo bad at design.</description>

It looks crazy simple, but there&amp;#8217;s actually a lot of processing and caching code going on. It&amp;#8217;s about 250 lines of PHP, with some simple jQuery on the front end. (update) Now it&amp;#8217;s in the side bar to the right.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on some code to display various pieces of my web life here on cleverswine.net. My first chosen task is to display my recently listened to album covers from Last.fm (like you see in the side bar to the right). I could have used the widget that I&amp;#8217;m currently using, but my end goal is a little different (more on that later). Plus, I&amp;#8217;m learning PHP, and it&amp;#8217;s always fun to learn a new language.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve just installed the BitNami WordPress Stack on my laptop and it was so easy, and so cool! After the install, I had a fully functioning WordPress up and running locally &amp;#8211; complete with Apache, MySql, and PHP. After installation, I exported all of the data from cleverswine.net and imported it locally &amp;#8211; again, super easy. As a result, I have a copy of my web site running locally that I can play around with.</description>

      <description>I just bought a Netgear RND2175 ReadyNAS Duo 750 GB Desktop Network Attached Storage from Amazon.com. I&amp;#8217;ve been looking at these for a while, and finally decided on this one. The device holds 2 750gb drives which are mirrored for constant data redundancy. In addition, it runs an embedded version of Linux and can do pretty much anything a Linux computer can do. There&amp;#8217;s an active user and developer community for help with every aspect of the system, including extending it and customizing it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty happy with the current state of cleverswine.net, but I think it&amp;#8217;s time for a redesign. I would like to de-emphasize the blogging portion of the site and instead create something more like a portal. I use quite a few web sites that provide activity feeds (Facebook, Delicious, Amazon, Netflix, Last.fm, and Flickr to name a few). Since I rarely blog anything of interest, I&amp;#8217;m thinking that the main content on cleverswine.</description>

Q. How did the programmer die in the shower?
A. He read the shampoo bottle instructions: Lather. Rinse. Repeat.
 Programming is like sex: One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.  All programmers are playwrights, and all computers are lousy actors.

      <description>After 8 fruitful years with Portland General Electric, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to give independent software consulting a try. My first gig is at Avenue A | Razorfish. As I really enjoy writing software, this feels like a natural course. I foresee interesting challenges, fun projects, and a chance to co-mingle with the many great minds of Portland.

      <description>While considering the fun of programming today, I came up with a new mantra: “Software development should be like a mullet &amp;#8211; business in the front, party in the back.”
Today&amp;#8217;s biggest buzzword in the industry is “software as a service”. I propose that we toss that idea, and instead standardize on “software as a mullet”. The new approach will focus on having fun during the software lifecycle, while producing business approved results.</description>

      <description>Hmmm, the Google App Engine is all over the &amp;#8220;blogosphere&amp;#8221; today. I first read about Google&amp;#8217;s new service yesterday, so I promptly signed up to be a beta tester. Today, I was invited to join 10,0000 other programmers to give the App Engine a trial run.
The App Engine is being greeted with mixed feelings by the developer community. Personally, after reading the documentation and API, I can&amp;#8217;t think of a good reason to use it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using Vagalume, a last.fm player, on my internet tablet. This might be one of the best and most useful pieces of software that I&amp;#8217;ve ever used. I particularly like the neighborhood radio feature, which plays songs from last.fm users that have similar tastes to mine. It&amp;#8217;s like having a portable radio that only plays stuff that I like.</description>

      <description>Just a couple of days ago, I was using XMLSpy at work to do some test XSLT transformations. Our XSL templates here at work are pretty complex, with a few xsl:include tags to import common code. After trying for nearly a day to get XMLSpy to render my transformations, I gave up. I tried every available rendering engine, I tried inserting all of the included code into one file, I tried simplifying the XML &amp;#8211; all to no avail.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s my fourth day in IBM Websphere training. I&amp;#8217;m becoming an expert with Process Server (cough cough). It&amp;#8217;s been a long time since I&amp;#8217;ve been in a training class that really challenges me. As an old school procedural programmer, it&amp;#8217;s a bit mind-blowing to design processes visually. I&amp;#8217;m a proponent of simple, straight-forward software design &amp;#8211; which Process Server is not. I&amp;#8217;m not knocking Process Server, it&amp;#8217;s actually quite a cool tool.</description>

      <description>While reading my daily dose of the Data Portability mailing list, I uncovered an interesting idea that could solve a problem that I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about for a long time. That problem would be the inability to share personal address books (PAB) across multiple computers. The project is called CardDAV. Think of it as IMAP for email, or WebDAV for files. So far, it&amp;#8217;s just an idea. I certainly hope the idea becomes a specification and is adopted by the major address book applications.</description>

 Our goal is to make content on the Web more useful and discoverable by taking advantage of your social connections. FriendFeed is a simple tool that scratches the surface of that goal by making it easier to keep track of the web pages, videos, music, and photos your friends and family interact with around the Internet.</description>

      <description>I just finish developing another weight loss application with Ruby on Rails. For the most part, it&amp;#8217;s nothing noteworthy &amp;#8211; just your standard Rails MVC project with simple views. The one tiny noteworthy thing is that I made use of the Google Chart API for charting the progress of one&amp;#8217;s diet. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t call it an API&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s more like a URL query string specification. Anyway, I created a model attribute to mine one&amp;#8217;s weigh-in history and produce a query string for the Google Chart API URL.</description>

As we don&amp;#8217;t even know where the wedding will be, the web site is far from done. Below is a sneak preview of what it will look like. Ignore the wedding date &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s just a placeholder.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;#8217;m engaged, the obvious next step is to build a web site for the wedding. So far, I&amp;#8217;m looking at four choices.
 Brides.com has a free web site builder. The template looks really nice, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be real flexible. TheKnot.com also has a free web site builder. It seems a little basic and inflexible. I could create my own, with a subdomain like wedding.cleverswine.net. I would hate to reinvent the wheel, though.</description>

 The KnitML Project&amp;#8217;s main goal is to develop and promote adoption of a standard content model for knitting patterns. By developing a community-supported specification (KnitML) and providing basic rendering and transformation tools, the KnitML Project aims to make KnitML easy to use and valuable to the knitter.</description>

      <description>I started a new Ruby on Rails project today, and I decided to create the database using migrations. I should have been doing this all along, but I never really understood migrations or what the benefit might be. Well, now I know. In about 10 minutes, I created my Rails migration files, and then I ran &amp;#8220;rake db:migrate&amp;#8221;. Bam! There was my MySQL database, just as I had planned for it to look.</description>

      <title>Code Library</title>

      <description>I enhanced my code library application by applying an Ext JS front end to it. The coolest part is the tree on the left. You can drag/drop code and categories to rearrange them and the changes are saved asynchronously to the database via ajax. I&amp;#8217;m hoping that it&amp;#8217;s user-friendly enough that I&amp;#8217;ll start using it as a code sample repository.</description>

      <description>I finally got upgraded to Windows XP at work. I was using Windows 2000 until now. I am currently reinstalling all of my development tools, giving me time to write on my web site (and clean up my desk). My reason for making an &amp;#8220;urgent&amp;#8221; request for Windows XP is that it has remote desktop capability built in. With this, I can VPN to work and then remote to my desktop.</description>

      <description>I added a tool to the side bar on the right from which you can send a text message to my cell phone. Pretty cool, eh?</description>

      <description>I got a 4gb SD card for my PDA and installed the root filesystem to it. That means I have tons of room for extra software and stuff.</description>

      <description>According to the Programmer Personality Test, my programmer personality type is DHSC:
You&amp;#8217;re a Doer.
You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.
You like coding at a High level.
The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.</description>

      <description>I joined Weight Watchers about 2.5 weeks ago. Because I&amp;#8217;m a geek, I wrote a small web application to manage my daily points (rather than using pen and paper). It is written with Ruby on Rails, using the Ext JS framework. Here is a screenshot:</description>

      <title>New Rails Project (with Ext JS)</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a new Ruby on Rails project for the past week. What I&amp;#8217;m aiming for is a well organized, simple, easy to use code snippet library. There are plenty of community code snippet sites out there, but I found that I needed my own personal collection of code since I know what I&amp;#8217;m likely to need. When I first started this project, I heard about Ext JS, which is a toolkit for Ajax and UI components.</description>

      <title>I like WordPress</title>

      <description>The longer I use WordPress, the more I like it. It has quite a few features, but they don&amp;#8217;t get in the way of simplicity. I&amp;#8217;m finding it easy to add content, pages, and links, all &amp;#8220;willy-nilly&amp;#8221;. Customizing the appearance isn&amp;#8217;t that difficult if you&amp;#8217;re familiar with CSS and/or PHP. There are also &amp;#8220;plugins&amp;#8221; galore, such as these. A good experience so far.
I might also mention thatÂ a2 web hosting has been phenomenal so far.</description>
