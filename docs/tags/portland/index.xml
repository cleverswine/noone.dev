      <description>On December 5th, we attended the Houston Rockets @ Portland Trailblazers game. We sat way up in the 300 section, but we had mid-court aisle seats which turned out to be quite nice. Portland won the game &amp;#8211; and they have won all 3 games we&amp;#8217;ve been to (against tough opponents). I think we bring good luck&amp;#8230; for wins. Unfortunately, we were witness to the season ending injury of Greg Oden.</description>

      <description>For my birthday, I went to Rogue (as I have done for the past 7 years in a row) and got a free beer and t-shirt. Bren and I took the next day off of work and had a delicious meal at Salvador Molly&amp;#8217;s and took a hike around Gabriel Park. It was a fantastic birthday. Now that I&amp;#8217;m in my &amp;#8220;late 30s&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;, I may choose to do something different next year.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8230;this web site is way out of date. I&amp;#8217;m working on a replacement that is less of a blog and more of an aggregator. It&amp;#8217;s slow going due to my lack of free time lately, but it will be here one day. Meanwhile, try the links in the header for more up to date Kevin data.
What&amp;#8217;s going on? We&amp;#8217;re attempting to sell our house and move closer in to Portland.</description>

      <title>Spring Beer &amp;#038; Wine Festival</title>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re heading over to the Spring Beer &amp;#038; Wine Festival this afternoon. I prefer the spring event because it&amp;#8217;s indoors and much less crowded than the summer or winter ones. Walking Man brewery has a couple of interestingly named beers at the fest: Streetwalker Malt Liquor and Big Black Homo. I may have to try them based on the names alone.</description>

      <description>The yard,
originally uploaded by cleverswine.
  This is our back yard. I have no idea how many inches we have so far, but I&amp;#8217;d roughly estimate 12&amp;#8243;. It&amp;#8217;s still coming down as of Monday morning. After driving to the MAX station this morning, I&amp;#8217;m ready for the snow to be gone. Driving through it makes me very nervous.

      <description>Like most of the U.S., we&amp;#8217;re getting our fair share of frigid weather in the Northwest. We got some snow on Sunday, and there&amp;#8217;s plenty more to come in the next week. I&amp;#8217;m excited, but I can definitely see why some people don&amp;#8217;t want to live where it snows a lot. For ongoing photos of the Portland area snow storm of 2008, check the flickr pool: Portland Snow Day 2008. Also check mine.</description>

      <description>This morning I was browsing Weather Underground because there are lots of neat weather related features on that site (almanacs, astrology, maps galore, etc). I was looking through the various Portland weather stations and came across one called &amp;#8220;Felony Flats, Portland, OR&amp;#8220;. I thought that was pretty funny. What&amp;#8217;s funnier is the link to the station&amp;#8217;s web site: Coffin Cruisers Hearse Club of Portland. I had no idea there existed a community of people who drive hearses (and have personal weather stations).</description>

      <description>From Portland Metblogs:
Why do people feel compelled to take a summer vacation &amp;#8211; when everyone else is doing so &amp;#8211; prices are higher &amp;#8211; it’s hot and sticky and gross outside?

      <description>I went out to ???????? ????? ????????Uwajimaya in Beaverton for the first time yesterday. It&amp;#8217;s a neat store, having everything Asian. We ate some Japanese food at the adjoined restaurant. Yummy.</description>

      <description>What do random people talk about in Portland?
Part voyeur daydream, part sad commentary on life as we know it, Overheard in PDX is a never-ending stream of the strange things that come out of other people’s mouths, submitted by people who were lucky(?) enough to hear them.
Example:
 At the main library downtown, waiting for a computer, a guy (mid-to-late 30&amp;#8217;s) shamelessly (and embarassingly) attempting to flirt with an 18 year-old PSU freshman (who says her R&amp;#8217;s like W&amp;#8217;s):</description>
