      <description>When Obama wins…
Starbucks will stop referring to their smalls as talls.
Your recycling will sort itself and magically appear by the curb.
Charlie Brown will finally kick that football.
Your cell phone won’t work in your car, at the movies, or while you’re ahead of me in line for coffee.
People will have more picnics in the park.

      <title>Beaumont&amp;#8217;s Black Problem</title>

      <description>From the Beaumont Enterprise (in Texas, where I grew up):
 West Brook High School administrators on Wednesday defended a black-male-only mentoring session that has prompted a recent inquiry by the American Civil Liberties Union.
 So, this high school in Beaumont decides to call an assembly of students to address issues such as education, test scores, crime, family and gangs. Good for them, except… they only invited black males! Now the ACLU is mad, and the school district is puzzled.</description>

      <title>Obama in 30 Seconds</title>

      <description>This is a great idea. MoveOn.org is sponsoring a contest where anyone can make a 30 second Obama commercial and enter to win. MoveOn.org will then pay to air the winning video on national television. The list of judges is really impressive!

      <title>Hillary Clinton speaks in Nederland</title>

      <description>My tiny Southeast Texas home of Nederland was recently host to Hillary Clinton, Ted Danson, and Mary Steenburgen. 600 people showed up for Hillary’s campaign propaganda. I’d say she’s being pretty thorough to make a stop in Nederland. Maybe that’s how she won Texas. So strange. Meanwhile, Forest Whitaker was in nearby Beaumont doing his thing for Obama.</description>
