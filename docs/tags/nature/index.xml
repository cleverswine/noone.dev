      <description>Spring was here for a few days, but the cool, wet weather is returning this week. We planted some veggies in the few spots where we get sunlight. Hopefully we&amp;#8217;ll get something out of them.</description>

      <description>We went to the garden show at the Clackamas County Fairgrounds this weekend. We actually didn&amp;#8217;t buy all that much, just about 10-12 plants. Here&amp;#8217;s Bren&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Today is the first perfect day of the year! It&amp;#8217;s sunny and 70 degrees outside. Bren is working on her gardens, and I&amp;#8217;m geeking out on the laptop. On flickr, you will find some photos of our first Spring outdoor session (taken from my laptop camera).</description>

      <title>Sometimes It Snows In April</title>

      <description>Okay, it&amp;#8217;s not actually April yet, but I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to use the phrase &amp;#8220;Sometimes It Snows In April,&amp;#8221; which is a Prince song from the movie Under the Cherry Moon. It&amp;#8217;s almost April, and snow is in the forecast for tomorrow morning. The forecast tends to change daily, of course, so we&amp;#8217;ll see if it really happens. Nonetheless, I am excited by the prospect!</description>

      <description>The temperature dropped into the 20s last night! There was ice on the lawn. So much for Spring.
Update: the forecast is calling for snow tomorrow night!</description>
