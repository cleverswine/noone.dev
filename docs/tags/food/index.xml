      <description>Pasta Sauce and Blueberry Jam
Originally uploaded by cleverswine

Bren has canning fever. It all started with a canning book that she received as a Christmas present. Now, she has canned (or jarred as I like to call it) Salsa, Pasta Sauce, Blueberry Jam, and Sweet Pickles. The nice thing is that we&amp;#8217;ll be well stocked with food that we know is locally grown and chemical free.</description>

      <description>We did this week&amp;#8217;s grocery shopping at Food Front in the Hillsdale neighborhood. They carry many local and organic food products. And, it may be my imagination, but local eggs fresh from the chicken taste so much better than the mass produced commercial eggs.</description>
