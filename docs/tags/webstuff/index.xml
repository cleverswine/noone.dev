      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking for a while about moving my simple web site and blog to a different platform. I&amp;#8217;m currently paying to host everything on a traditional hosting service. Ten years ago, this was really the only option if you wanted buy a domain and put a web site out there (there was also self hosting with dynamic DNS, but I was never brave enough to open up my home network).</description>

      <description>This morning I was browsing Weather Underground because there are lots of neat weather related features on that site (almanacs, astrology, maps galore, etc). I was looking through the various Portland weather stations and came across one called &amp;#8220;Felony Flats, Portland, OR&amp;#8220;. I thought that was pretty funny. What&amp;#8217;s funnier is the link to the station&amp;#8217;s web site: Coffin Cruisers Hearse Club of Portland. I had no idea there existed a community of people who drive hearses (and have personal weather stations).</description>

      <description>I know it&amp;#8217;s lame to duplicate a blog post from someone else, but I must quote what I saw on Jason Kottke&amp;#8217;s web site today. I guess I&amp;#8217;m one of the 5k at the moment.
 Some days, the web feels like 5 people trying to make something; 5k people turning it into a list; and 500MM people saying, &amp;#8220;FAIL.&amp;#8221;

My contracting job is almost up, and we banged out this web site in 6 weeks: http://www.xrankcelebrity5.com/. There&amp;#8217;s a good chance that I will stay and work full time for this company (Avenue A | Razorfish).

      <description>So I&amp;#8217;ve been using FriendFeed for a few months now. It basically aggregates my online activity (mostly via &amp;#8220;social&amp;#8221; networks like Facebook and Flickr) and then provides a feed for anyone to consume. It&amp;#8217;s not a bad idea, but it&amp;#8217;s really too bad that we need something like this. I think it&amp;#8217;s a sign that the social web is out of control. Anyway, I find it useful to track what my friends are doing on the web, since we have similar interests.</description>

      <description>Seeing a web nerd speak from the heart, for the whole world to see, is not all that common. I was pleasantly surprised when I came across this post on zenhabits. The author has written a letter to his 3 year old son, giving him advice on being happy in life&amp;#8217;s journey. Note all of the positive comments that follow the post. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t suggest that web nerds make a habit of this, as it would cease to be special, but it&amp;#8217;s a nice break from the mundane &amp;#8220;how-to&amp;#8221; articles.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve no time lately to write anything interesting, so I&amp;#8217;ll present a list of interesting things that others have produced&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;m very tempted to hand over $10 for this&amp;#8230;

      <description>What do random people talk about in Portland?
Part voyeur daydream, part sad commentary on life as we know it, Overheard in PDX is a never-ending stream of the strange things that come out of other people’s mouths, submitted by people who were lucky(?) enough to hear them.
Example:
 At the main library downtown, waiting for a computer, a guy (mid-to-late 30&amp;#8217;s) shamelessly (and embarassingly) attempting to flirt with an 18 year-old PSU freshman (who says her R&amp;#8217;s like W&amp;#8217;s):</description>

      <description>When Obama wins&amp;#8230;
Starbucks will stop referring to their smalls as talls.
Your recycling will sort itself and magically appear by the curb.
Charlie Brown will finally kick that football.
Your cell phone won&amp;#8217;t work in your car, at the movies, or while you&amp;#8217;re ahead of me in line for coffee.
People will have more picnics in the park.

      <description>Centennial High School has dropped its ban on eyebrow shaving&amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s right, the kids are shaving their eyebrows. I guess there&amp;#8217;s a trend in which kids shave designs into their brows. Unfortunately, a well known East Multnomah County gang does the same, which caused a bit of confusion and concern in this particular high school. I remember back when I was in school. It was the eighties, and the more over the top you could be, the better.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been reading The Infinite Book: A Short Guide to the Boundless, Timeless and Endless, which so far is a history of theories on infinity. Infinity is something that I&amp;#8217;ve always been interested in, but I had never read theories predating Hawking. I came across an article on the web today called A Brain Cell is the Same as the Universe. I&amp;#8217;m afraid a brain cell is not like the universe.</description>

      <description>Just in case someone doesn&amp;#8217;t already know, Portland is awesome. Some of our local techies and bloggers have started a new web site where various citizens of P-town can express why they think our city is cool. I was wondering if they would get enough authors to make it worthwhile, but sure enough the articles keep on coming.
If you are interested at all in the culture and general environment of Portland, I would recommend reading PortlandIsAwesome.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m off to Texas tomorrow morning to visit family and see my new niece. I regularly keep up with Texas news, but I casually read it and move on. Today I came across an unusual story&amp;#8230; well, unusual to those of us in the North. A man in Brazoria was routinely pulled over for making an illegal u-turn. The police found a 6 foot alligator and a water moccasin in his car, both alive.</description>

      <description>From the Beaumont Enterprise (in Texas, where I grew up):
 West Brook High School administrators on Wednesday defended a black-male-only mentoring session that has prompted a recent inquiry by the American Civil Liberties Union.
 So, this high school in Beaumont decides to call an assembly of students to address issues such as education, test scores, crime, family and gangs. Good for them, except&amp;#8230; they only invited black males! Now the ACLU is mad, and the school district is puzzled.</description>

      <description>Hmmm, the Google App Engine is all over the &amp;#8220;blogosphere&amp;#8221; today. I first read about Google&amp;#8217;s new service yesterday, so I promptly signed up to be a beta tester. Today, I was invited to join 10,0000 other programmers to give the App Engine a trial run.
The App Engine is being greeted with mixed feelings by the developer community. Personally, after reading the documentation and API, I can&amp;#8217;t think of a good reason to use it.</description>

      <description>Well, I got fooled left and right yesterday! I guess I am naive&amp;#8230;
My favorite embedded device developer, Marcin Juszkiewicz, claimed that he was moving from Poland to London for work. He said that with his new job, he could spend more time in the office and less time taking care of his child. Sounded reasonable to me. He was kidding.
I&amp;#8217;m still not clear about this one, but seeing as it was tagged on delicious as &amp;#8220;aprilfools&amp;#8221;, I&amp;#8217;m guessing it wasn&amp;#8217;t real.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m generally disappointed with the state of the World Wide Web these days. The WWW used to be a simple communications tool to share information on a globally connected network. I&amp;#8217;m not saying that it should have stayed that way, but I wish we had taken a more structured approach to innovation. I&amp;#8217;ve written about this before, so I won&amp;#8217;t go into it again. My point for today is that Last.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently rediscovered the joy of comic books. Joss Whedon was kind enough to continue the Buffy the Vampire Slayer T.V. series via comic book. Reading the Buffy comic has been just as fulfilling as watching the show. Now, in addition to Buffy, I am reading The Umbrella Academy which is written by Gerard way of My Chemical Romance. I admit, I was unsure about reading a comic written by a rock star, but so far it is really good.</description>

      <description>I would not normally advocate Wal-Mart, as they are evil in so many ways, but I&amp;#8217;ve been reading the Wal-Mart blog lately. It&amp;#8217;s called Check Out. I don&amp;#8217;t know exactly who the &amp;#8220;associates&amp;#8221; are that write on this blog, but it does bring a human side to the company. Obviously, it&amp;#8217;s a marketing ploy, but I still enjoy reading it. It is G rated and censored (no foul language allowed), like the store.</description>

      <description>My tiny Southeast Texas home of Nederland was recently host to Hillary Clinton, Ted Danson, and Mary Steenburgen. 600 people showed up for Hillary&amp;#8217;s campaign propaganda. I&amp;#8217;d say she&amp;#8217;s being pretty thorough to make a stop in Nederland. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s how she won Texas. So strange. Meanwhile, Forest Whitaker was in nearby Beaumont doing his thing for Obama.</description>

      <description>While reading my daily dose of the Data Portability mailing list, I uncovered an interesting idea that could solve a problem that I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about for a long time. That problem would be the inability to share personal address books (PAB) across multiple computers. The project is called CardDAV. Think of it as IMAP for email, or WebDAV for files. So far, it&amp;#8217;s just an idea. I certainly hope the idea becomes a specification and is adopted by the major address book applications.</description>

      <description>A friend just told me about FriendFeed, which is sort of a social web aggregater. Rather than try to explain it, here&amp;#8217;s what they say about themselves:
 Our goal is to make content on the Web more useful and discoverable by taking advantage of your social connections. FriendFeed is a simple tool that scratches the surface of that goal by making it easier to keep track of the web pages, videos, music, and photos your friends and family interact with around the Internet.</description>

      <description>I sort of learned a new word today: couture. As I was browsing the news, I came across a J.Lo article which warranted my attention (because J.Lo is&amp;#8230; super cool). The title of the article is &amp;#8220;Even J.Lo’s hospital gowns have to be couture.&amp;#8221; I had no idea what that meant, so I looked up couture on dictionary.com. I still don&amp;#8217;t know what it means. Perhaps she needs designer gowns in the hospital?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve just discovered a hot sauce named after one of my favorite 80s straight edge punk bands, Minor Threat. Pitchfork says it&amp;#8217;s so. It sounds delicious!
 Made from a rare, mild breed of habaneros grown specifically for us, Minor Threat draws its inspiration from the legendary West Indies&amp;#8217; mustard- and mango-based habanero sauces, only it mysteriously priviledges the pepper&amp;#8217;s fruitiness over its notoriously overwhelming heat.

      <description>I may have found something geeky that Bren and I can have in common. I&amp;#8217;m talking about KnitML. KnitML is a new markup language (like html or xml) used to describe knitting patterns. How geeky is that?
 The KnitML Project&amp;#8217;s main goal is to develop and promote adoption of a standard content model for knitting patterns. By developing a community-supported specification (KnitML) and providing basic rendering and transformation tools, the KnitML Project aims to make KnitML easy to use and valuable to the knitter.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve always wondered where the term &amp;#8220;counting sheep&amp;#8221; came from. I&amp;#8217;ve tried counting sheep to fall asleep, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t work. In my case, the sheep don&amp;#8217;t cooperate. Come to find out&amp;#8230;
 &amp;#8230;counting sheep is actually an inferior means of inducing sleep. Subjects who instead imagined &amp;#8220;a beach or a waterfall&amp;#8221; were forced to expend more mental energy, and fell asleep faster than those asked to simply count sheep.</description>

      <description>In the newest issue of NME (a British magazine about new music), there is a cover story on Morrissey. Morrissey and NME have always been at odds, but it has generally been tame. This time, however, rather than just publishing the Morrissey interview as it was done, NME decided to add commentary that totally trashes the man. I&amp;#8217;ve not read the article, titled &amp;#8220;Has the World Changed, or Has He Changed?</description>

His new show is called &amp;#8220;The Dollhouse&amp;#8221; and stars Eliza Dushku (Faith, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer)! It will air on Fox sometime next year. Unfortunately, the writer&amp;#8217;s strike will postpone it for a while, but Fox has already agreed to 7 episodes.

I&amp;#8217;d say that&amp;#8217;s quite impressive considering that there are only 8 U.S. cities in the top 50. It looks like Switzerland is really the place to be.
