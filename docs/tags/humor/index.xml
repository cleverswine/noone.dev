      <description>This morning I was browsing Weather Underground because there are lots of neat weather related features on that site (almanacs, astrology, maps galore, etc). I was looking through the various Portland weather stations and came across one called “Felony Flats, Portland, OR“. I thought that was pretty funny. What’s funnier is the link to the station’s web site: Coffin Cruisers Hearse Club of Portland. I had no idea there existed a community of people who drive hearses (and have personal weather stations).</description>

      <description>Being a web developer and active browser of the web for many years now, I see a lot of wasted web space (including this web site). I would venture to say that 90% of web sites out there are useless and/or uninteresting, or just a rehash of other web sites that are slightly more interesting.
And then there’s Batting Stance Guy, which is the best use of the web that I’ve seen lately.</description>

      <description>The truth hurts. I’ve been trying to lose weight for 8 months now, and I’ve lost nothing. None of these truths are surprising, yet I’ve ignored almost all of them. I will be pleasantly plump for my wedding.

Starbucks will stop referring to their smalls as talls.
Your recycling will sort itself and magically appear by the curb.
Charlie Brown will finally kick that football.
Your cell phone won’t work in your car, at the movies, or while you’re ahead of me in line for coffee.
People will have more picnics in the park.

Q. How did the programmer die in the shower?
A. He read the shampoo bottle instructions: Lather. Rinse. Repeat.
 Programming is like sex: One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. All programmers are playwrights, and all computers are lousy actors.

      <description>Centennial High School has dropped its ban on eyebrow shaving… that’s right, the kids are shaving their eyebrows. I guess there’s a trend in which kids shave designs into their brows. Unfortunately, a well known East Multnomah County gang does the same, which caused a bit of confusion and concern in this particular high school. I remember back when I was in school. It was the eighties, and the more over the top you could be, the better.</description>

      <description>I’m off to Texas tomorrow morning to visit family and see my new niece. I regularly keep up with Texas news, but I casually read it and move on. Today I came across an unusual story… well, unusual to those of us in the North. A man in Brazoria was routinely pulled over for making an illegal u-turn. The police found a 6 foot alligator and a water moccasin in his car, both alive.</description>

      <guid>/2008/04/10/software-as-a-mullet/</guid>
      <description>While considering the fun of programming today, I came up with a new mantra: “Software development should be like a mullet – business in the front, party in the back.”
Today’s biggest buzzword in the industry is “software as a service”. I propose that we toss that idea, and instead standardize on “software as a mullet”. The new approach will focus on having fun during the software lifecycle, while producing business approved results.</description>

      <description>Well, I got fooled left and right yesterday! I guess I am naive…
My favorite embedded device developer, Marcin Juszkiewicz, claimed that he was moving from Poland to London for work. He said that with his new job, he could spend more time in the office and less time taking care of his child. Sounded reasonable to me. He was kidding.
I’m still not clear about this one, but seeing as it was tagged on delicious as “aprilfools”, I’m guessing it wasn’t real.</description>

      <description>Why is it that everyone is so motivated to help out shy people? I can guarantee you that if you aren’t severely shy, then you have no idea what it’s like. I came across this article today: The Shy Person’s Guide to Talking to Strangers.
Okay, first of all, I barely talk to my friends, family, or the person I’m going to marry, so why would I seek out lessons on talking to strangers?</description>

I must be old, because as I scan through the list, I keep saying “oh yeah, I’ve done that.” Here are some examples of how old I am… Rabbit ears. PASCAL. Dialing a rotary phone. Formatting a floppy. Putting a needle on a vinyl record. Rewinding VCR tapes.</description>

      <description>When I was a teenager, I collected locks of hair from all of my female friends and girlfriends. I must have had 30 clumps of hair, each tied neatly with a piece of ribbon. At the time, I thought there was nothing strange about it. In retrospect, however, it seems a bit psycho. I mention this because I just read an article about this year’s President’s Day.
 For the first time, The Academy of Natural Sciences is displaying a scrapbook that has locks of hair from the first 12 U.</description>

      <description>I sort of learned a new word today: couture. As I was browsing the news, I came across a J.Lo article which warranted my attention (because J.Lo is… super cool). The title of the article is “Even J.Lo’s hospital gowns have to be couture.” I had no idea what that meant, so I looked up couture on dictionary.com. I still don’t know what it means. Perhaps she needs designer gowns in the hospital?</description>

      <description>I bet Nintendo had no idea that their WII gaming console would make such a splash in nursing homes. Apprently, the WII is all the rage in the elderly world. Some homes have regular tournaments with the sports games. For example, here is an article about a recent bowling tournament.
 When asked to comment on the 202 to 182 stunner, the few other residents who were both awake at the time and able to remember the action agreed that the match was surely one for the record books.</description>

      <description>Last night, while hanging out and watching TV, we heard a chorus of children’s voices coming from our front yard. Naturally, our initial reaction was one of terror. We slouched down on the couch to hide from the little singing monsters. Then, the doorbell rang. We, of course, did not answer it. After about an hour, when we knew that the monsters were gone, we opened the front door. On the doorstep, we found a Mormon DVD about Jesus Christ.</description>

      <description>Caring for Your Introvert
This is an interesting article about introverts and how to deal with them. I wonder why I’d post about such a subject? My favorite part is:
 How can I let the introvert in my life know that I support him and respect his choice?
First, recognize that it’s not a choice. It’s not a lifestyle. It’s an orientation.
Second, when you see an introvert lost in thought, don’t say “What’s the matter?</description>

      <description>We saw Hairspray last night, which is the movie version of the Broadway musical which is based on a movie by John Waters. I was pleased to see a cameo by John Waters at the beginning, as I am a fan of his. The movie was pretty good, and does the original justice. If you can tolerate a musical I’d recommend it.
Tonight we are going to see Mama Mia, which is a musical play featuring music from Abba.</description>

A Conversation at the Grownup Table, as Imagined at the Kidsâ€™ Table
MOM: Pass the wine, please. I want to become crazy.
DAD: O.K.
GRANDMOTHER: Did you see the politics? It made me angry.
DAD: Me, too. When it was over, I had sex.
UNCLE: Iâ€™m having sex right now.
DAD: We all are.
MOM: Letâ€™s talk about which kid I like the best.</description>

      <description>The longer I use WordPress, the more I like it. It has quite a few features, but they don’t get in the way of simplicity. I’m finding it easy to add content, pages, and links, all “willy-nilly”. Customizing the appearance isn’t that difficult if you’re familiar with CSS and/or PHP. There are also “plugins” galore, such as these. A good experience so far.
I might also mention thatÂ a2web hosting has been phenomenal so far.</description>
