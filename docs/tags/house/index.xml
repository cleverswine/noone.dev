      <title>New Deck</title>

      <description>Our new deck is complete and it’s much nicer than the old one. The flooring is composite material from TimberTech and the railing is aluminum. We plan to stain the wood skirting to better match the deck and house color, but we’ll have to wait until it stops raining. As a bonus, we have a decent sized storage area underneath part of the deck.</description>

      <description>After a few weeks of shopping in and around Portland, we finally landed some nice office furniture at a reasonable price. City Liquidatorsturns out to be the place for furniture (and other things ranging from tampons to sofas). Next up, we’ll be painting the room.</description>

      <title>New Couch</title>

      <description>We got our new couch from JCPenney last weekend. We weren’t expecting it until mid-December because we had custom fabric put on it. We’re glad to have it for Thanksgiving because we’re having company over for food and games. I think the red (berry) fabric was a good choice, as it adds some color to the room and it matches the chair we recently purchased. The rug is new as well.</description>

      <description>We moved in to our new house Friday. I don’t have many photos yet because we are still unpacking. So far, almost everything has gone well. DirecTV is unwilling to get on our roof to install the satellite dish. Apparently, it is unsafe. We’ve asked for a second opinion from another installer, so we’ll see. Other than that, all is good!
Some photos are here, with more to come as we get settled in.</description>
