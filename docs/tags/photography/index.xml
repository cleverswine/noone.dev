      <description>We built a small raised vegetable garden this year in one of the only spots in our yard that gets more than 4 hours of sunshine. It happens to be next to the driveway, but that&amp;#8217;s okay.</description>

This summer is getting off to a slow start, as are our vegetables. We planted tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, various peppers, and carrots. So far we haven&amp;#8217;t picked a thing. We&amp;#8217;ve barely reached the 80s in temperature, and we&amp;#8217;ve had more rain than usual. However, despite the lack of veggies, I&amp;#8217;m personally enjoying the cool summer.</description>

      <description>These are my favorite albums, in no particular order&amp;#8230;
My Winter Storm by Tarja
Tarja used to sing with Nightwish, but has recently gone solo. She has one of the greatest female voices that I&amp;#8217;ve ever heard.
Beautiful Death by Bella Morte
This is still one of the best albums I&amp;#8217;ve heard in the past 10 years or so.
Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys by My Chemical Romace</description>

      <description>We went to the garden show at the Clackamas County Fairgrounds this weekend. We actually didn&amp;#8217;t buy all that much, just about 10-12 plants. Here&amp;#8217;s Bren&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve just returned from our trip to Texas, where we saw all of my family and visited Galveston, Kemah, and Houston. We had a good time, but it&amp;#8217;s nice to be home in Oregon. The heat and humidity down there was a bit much. On flickr, you will find many photos from the trip.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;#8217;ve had enough of the Perfect Day (sun is bad), I&amp;#8217;ve migrated to the great indoors. There are at least 4 things I&amp;#8217;d like to be doing while indoors: listening to music, looking at photos, browsing the web, and watching baseball. As it turns out, I&amp;#8217;m doing all 4 at once! Check it out.</description>

      <description>On Friday, Bren wondered into the New Seasons Market in Happy Valley to find the brewer from Ninkasi giving a talk and presentation. She was kind enough to purchase my 3 favorite Ninkasi varieties. Ninkasi is based in Eugene, so I think it&amp;#8217;s cool that he came to make an appearance in Happy Valley for the beer-loving Portland area.</description>

      <description>We went to Outback Steakhouse last night to celebrate Carol&amp;#8217;s Birthday. Bren spent the whole day working on a card and a gift bag for her. Both turned out to be fabulous. Unfortunately we didn&amp;#8217;t take a photo of her work. We did, however take a couple of photos of the party.</description>

      <description>Now that Bren has a fancy camera (Nikon D40x), I can get good bird photos. I&amp;#8217;ve started a Flickr set for my bird photos here. I hope to get a large variety of Northwest birds into the set this summer.</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;#8217;t take it anymore. My beard was itchy and hairy and just annoying. Here&amp;#8217;s a photo taken just before I shaved. I&amp;#8217;m a beard failure.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve decided to go a few days without shaving, to see what would happen. Unsurprisingly, a beard is sprouting. I have to decide today whether to shave or not. It&amp;#8217;s a tough decision&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>There are some amazing bridges in the world. Someone has posted a list of their 10 favorite bridges here: 10 Most Beautiful Bridges in the World
I would have liked to have seen a Portland bridge in the list. Perhaps St. John&amp;#8217;s Bridge.</description>

      <description>Have I mentioned that The Viewpoint Inn (the location of our wedding) has chickens? They have their own chicken house at the back of the Inn. We were assured that these particular chickens, who have names, are not used in the kitchen.

      <description>We went back to the Viewpoint Inn today to take care of some wedding business. As luck would have it, today was a beautiful, mostly clear day. As luck would not have it, we didn&amp;#8217;t bring a real camera. As luck would have it, my cell phone has a camera on it. I took a handful of photos and added them to flickr.
This is my favorite photo from today&amp;#8217;s trip.</description>

      <description>We got a bit of snow last night in Gresham. I&amp;#8217;d say there was about 1.5&amp;#8243; when I left for work this morning, and I think it&amp;#8217;s supposed to snow some more throughout the day. In downtown Portland, there&amp;#8217;s pretty much nothing. I should have worked from home today so I could have played in the snow.</description>

      <description>There is a large construction site just outside of my building at work. The banging of the machines is insanely loud. It&amp;#8217;s tolerable from within the building, but when I walk outside, my eardrums are greeted with earthshaking (literally) noise. They are apparently building a new office high rise, right in front of the police building. Surely the employees there are angry because their view of the river and Mt. Hood will disappear.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s a warm and sunny day here in Portland. Not. It&amp;#8217;s actually a freezing and sunny day over here. I just walked to get lunch and I don&amp;#8217;t know if I&amp;#8217;ve ever been so cold! I think it&amp;#8217;s about 30+ degrees, but the wind is blowing hard. If it&amp;#8217;s going to be this cold, we should at least get snow out of it! We get enough sunshine in the summer.</description>

      <description>I had a brilliant idea. Since I work in downtown Portland, and frequently take walks around the city, I thought I&amp;#8217;d take photos of interesting things and post them here. I was going to start today during lunch, but it&amp;#8217;s way too friggin&amp;#8217; cold out there. I had to speed walk back to the heated office. I did get a decent shot of the parking garage that I park in. Woo hoo.</description>

      <description>Our latest outdoor project has been to rip up our stepping stone and moss path and replace it with stepping stones and gravel. The weeds became too much to handle when combined with the rest of the yard work, plus the moss was growing over the stepping stones. The job is complete now, but here&amp;#8217;sa photo in progress:</description>

      <description>We spent the weekend camping at Lost Lake. First, we stopped by the Bonneville Dam Fish Hatchery to check out some giant sturgeon. Then, we got lost on the way to Lost Lake. We were on a gravel road somewhere on the mountain for almost two hours. We finally re-found civilization and made our way to the campground. The weather was decent, but chilly and cloudy. We did some hiking and stuff.</description>

      <description>Today, we went to the Huckleberry Festival up near Mt Hood. It was disappointing, but we did get a delicious huckleberry shortcake and a huckleberry shake. After that, we took a hike on the nearby Old Salmon River Trail. Finally, we saw Superbad. I saw it as the current generation&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Fast Times&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;. Bren wasn&amp;#8217;t quite that impressed, but liked it.</description>

      <description>The Portland Ikea finally opened last week. We went and we shopped, but not on opening day. We actually didn&amp;#8217;t buy all that much. I got a new desk chair that is very mod looking. The couch that we&amp;#8217;ve been wanting for months has been disconinued and they had nothing else close enough to it. That was quite disappointing. For now we&amp;#8217;re stuck with my $80 Goodwill couch from the 70s.</description>

      <description>We are at Cannon Beach staying in a really nice motel/house &amp;#8211; The White Herron. It&amp;#8217;s cloudy and cool, but nice enough to enjoy ourselves. Today we&amp;#8217;ll be marching over to Haystack Rock, Pig &amp;#8216;n Pancake, Ecola Park, and Hug Point.

      <description>Well, our fruits, veggies, and other plants are doing quite well. Our veggie garden has pretty much outgrown it&amp;#8217;s container (as someone said it would). See my flickr page for lots o&amp;#8217; photos.

      <title>I Put Stickers on My Car</title>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2007/06/19/i-put-stickers-on-my-car/</guid>
      <description>I decided that my car is old enough to put stickers on it. I&amp;#8217;ve had a pile of Morrissey and Smiths stickers in storage for years (like, about 10-15 years). I put a couple of the Smiths ones on my rear window, along with an Astros sticker that I just purchased. I&amp;#8217;ll probably leave it at that because it looks tastefully done. I saw a great bumper sticker yesterday, which read &amp;#8220;Bumper Sticker&amp;#8221;.</description>
