      <description>We built a small raised vegetable garden this year in one of the only spots in our yard that gets more than 4 hours of sunshine. It happens to be next to the driveway, but that&amp;#8217;s okay.</description>

      <description>Pasta Sauce and Blueberry Jam
Originally uploaded by cleverswine

Bren has canning fever. It all started with a canning book that she received as a Christmas present. Now, she has canned (or jarred as I like to call it) Salsa, Pasta Sauce, Blueberry Jam, and Sweet Pickles. The nice thing is that we&amp;#8217;ll be well stocked with food that we know is locally grown and chemical free.</description>

This summer is getting off to a slow start, as are our vegetables. We planted tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, various peppers, and carrots. So far we haven&amp;#8217;t picked a thing. We&amp;#8217;ve barely reached the 80s in temperature, and we&amp;#8217;ve had more rain than usual. However, despite the lack of veggies, I&amp;#8217;m personally enjoying the cool summer.</description>
