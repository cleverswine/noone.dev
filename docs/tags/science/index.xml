      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been subscribing to Dr. Dobb&amp;#8217;s Journal for at least 10 years. It has always been my favorite technical magazine because of it&amp;#8217;s diversity of topics and brain-stirring articles. I got a letter in the mail last week saying that they were ceasing production of the full magazine. Instead, they will offer a Dr. Dobb&amp;#8217;s Report stuffed into issues of InformationWeek. I&amp;#8217;ll have to spend more time on their web site, as it looks like they have some good content on there.</description>

      <description>I was admiring the site of a beautiful seagull flying peacefully through downtown, when it suddenly dropped some poop in mid-flight. I watched the white poop fall from the bird to the ground. Then I got to thinking, why is bird poop white? A quick web search led me to Yahoo Answers. It turns out that birds don&amp;#8217;t urinate. They have one multipurpose hole for pee, poo, sex, and birth. Here&amp;#8217;s the detailed explanation.</description>
