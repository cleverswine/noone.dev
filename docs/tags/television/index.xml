      <description>I bought a PCTV 800e HD TV tuner card from Woot! some time ago, but never really used it. While watching The Office last night in high definition (using a cheap HD antenna, not a cable or satellite subscription), we were wishing that we could pause the show as we do with our DirecTV service. That’s when I remembered my tuner card purchase and decided to get that set up with our media PC today.</description>

      <title>The Heroes Season Premiere Was Lame</title>

      <description>We watched the season premiere of Heroes last night. We were warned by various sources that it would be bad, and they were not wrong. The story line seems desperate so far, as if the writers are more concerned about the hype than they are quality. The characters seem more shallow, and the dialog was just horrible (which can work in shows like “Buffy”, where dry humor and spoof are part of the game).</description>

      <description>Now that I’ve had enough of the Perfect Day (sun is bad), I’ve migrated to the great indoors. There are at least 4 things I’d like to be doing while indoors: listening to music, looking at photos, browsing the web, and watching baseball. As it turns out, I’m doing all 4 at once! Check it out.</description>

      <title>Six Feet Under</title>

      <description>We just finished watching the Six Feet Under complete series box set. What a great show that was! I was a little unsure about the ending, but now that I’ve had time to absorb it, I think it’s brilliant. For those who don’t know, the show was an HBO series about a family that runs and lives in a funeral home. The character development is wonderful, and the shooting style is similar to that of American Beauty (same writer/director).</description>
