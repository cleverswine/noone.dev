      <description>We’re heading over to the Spring Beer � Wine Festival this afternoon. I prefer the spring event because it’s indoors and much less crowded than the summer or winter ones. Walking Man brewery has a couple of interestingly named beers at the fest: Streetwalker Malt Liquor and Big Black Homo. I may have to try them based on the names alone.</description>

      <description>On Friday, Bren wondered into the New Seasons Market in Happy Valley to find the brewer from Ninkasi giving a talk and presentation. She was kind enough to purchase my 3 favorite Ninkasi varieties. Ninkasi is based in Eugene, so I think it’s cool that he came to make an appearance in Happy Valley for the beer-loving Portland area.</description>
