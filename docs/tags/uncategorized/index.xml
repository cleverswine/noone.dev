      <title>Matchbox Desktop Config</title>
      <link>http://noone.dev/2007/07/14/matchbox-desktop-config/</link>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2007/07/14/matchbox-desktop-config/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;#8217;m working on a new project for my PDA. The application will allow for configuring the Matchbox Desktop (which is the user interface for my PDA). Without this application, users of Matchbox (on a PDA anyway) must edit a series of configuration files in order to create folders and move programs from folder to folder. My program allows for adding/editing/deleting applications and folders. It&amp;#8217;s written in Python 2.4 using the GTK library for UI.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been hacking away at my Sharp Zaurus for a couple of years now. It has brought me great pleasure, but I&amp;#8217;m in need of a new toy. Anyone&amp;#8217;s input is appreciated. At the moment, my options are:
iPhone:
Pros: It looks nice and does lots of cool stuff (I assume). There will be a large software repository due to it&amp;#8217;s popularity.
Cons: It&amp;#8217;s Apple. I don&amp;#8217;t want a machine so tightly coupled with a corporation.</description>

      <description>We went on a nice camping trip to Beverly Beach, in Newport, last weekend. We also explored downtown Newport, going to the &amp;#8220;Ripley&amp;#8217;s Believe it or Not&amp;#8221; museum and the wax museum. Here is a video of the beach, and here are some photos.</description>

      <description>I have 2 fairly new toys that are exciting enough (to me) to write about. One is a 37&amp;#8243; LCD television from Olevia. I got a great deal on it, and we are very happy with it. Unfortunately, we don&amp;#8217;t have HD service yet. Soon. The other toy is a mouse for my PDA. The mouse itself isn&amp;#8217;t that impressive, but it gives my PDA a laptop feel. I&amp;#8217;m currently running Linux with ICEWM as the window manager.</description>

      <description>Work has kept me busy and tired, hence the lack of updates&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;m taking a small vacation to Seattle this weekend. We&amp;#8217;ll be seeing the Red Sox vs. Mariners on Sunday, and then we&amp;#8217;re going to Ikea on Monday. Before we take off to Seattle, we&amp;#8217;re going to see Bill Maher here in P-town.
I saw something disturbing yesterday: there are some crazy people that think the current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is a sign of the second coming of Christ, and they are happy about it.</description>

      <description>In experimenting with the GTK widget set (an open source, cross platform user interface library), I&amp;#8217;ve produced this little application to search Amazon.com for movie titles. The movies can be saved locally and be printed to make DVD covers, etc. It&amp;#8217;s not finished yet. Ruby is the language I&amp;#8217;ve chosen for this development.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m no longer using Netflix since I now have Directv with more channels than I know what to do with (including the MLB channels so I can watch the Astros make their way to the World Series again). I replaced the movie section of this page (below, to the right) with a music section, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m listening to&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;. Here I will link to the artist site and provide 1 full song for download.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve never been to a Kohl&amp;#8217;s before and now I know where I&amp;#8217;ll be buying most of my clothing. Their stuff is insanely cheap, and high quality (brand names). Today, I bought 15 pairs of black socks for about $18 total! I&amp;#8217;ll be disposing of my current inventory of socks and I&amp;#8217;ll never have to match them up again &amp;#8211; because my 15 pairs are all exactly the same!</description>

      <description>My new eye glasses have arrived. How do I look? Actually, that&amp;#8217;s Elvis Costello. I&amp;#8217;ll get a photo of myself in the near future. We&amp;#8217;re going to the grand re-opening of the Bridgeport Brewpub and Bakery this evening. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll take some photos there.</description>

      <description>I had my teeth cleaned today, for the first time in&amp;#8230; a while. I stand by my theory that the number of visits to the dentist is proportional to the number of tooth problems one has (the theory is not unfounded). I&amp;#8217;m thinking once every 18 months is often enough for cleaning.</description>

      <description>Rubbernecking is where drivers slow down to look at recent collisions or anything out of the ordinary on the highway.
No one likes a rubbernecker, so why does everyone do it?</description>

      <description>We got a little bit of snow in Lake Oswego last night, and more is forecast for this weekend. I guess spring isn&amp;#8217;t quite here yet.</description>

      <description>We took some old computer hardware to Free Geek today. Bren had an old school Tandy and a dot matrix printer stored away in the closet. I meant to take photos, in case the computer museum needed them, but I forgot. Meanwhile, I received a fabulous Valentine&amp;#8217;s Day present today (early, I know) &amp;#8211; a Creative Zen Micro 6gb mp3 player! Very nice, very nice. And if that isn&amp;#8217;t enough, we just ate stuffed bellpeppers made with fake ground meat.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m thinking that I&amp;#8217;ll look more like Drew Carey when I get my new glasses. I&amp;#8217;d never wear a suit, of course.</description>

      <description>I went to the optometrist today and ordered new glasses, similar to the ones pictured here (but not quite as extreme). My eyes were proclaimed healthy and they have only slightly degraded over the past 4 years (the last time I saw the optometrist).</description>

      <description>Stacy&amp;#8217;s Pita Chips are the best chips that I have ever tasted. I particularly like the Parmesan, Garlic &amp;#038; Herb and the Pesto &amp;#038; Sundried Tomato.</description>
