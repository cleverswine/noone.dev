      <title>My Favorite Albums (Right Now)</title>

      <description>This is what I&amp;#8217;m listening to&amp;#8230;
The Record by FEAR
This is old school punk from the early 80s, when punk rock was a means of expression and rebellion. This particular album is humorous and offensive, as punk should be.
Gothic Kabbalah by Therion
This isn&amp;#8217;t my favorite Therion album, but I&amp;#8217;ve been listening to it a lot lately because of some catchy songs. I find it good to write code to because it takes you to another world.</description>

      <description>These are my favorite albums, in no particular order&amp;#8230;
My Winter Storm by Tarja
Tarja used to sing with Nightwish, but has recently gone solo. She has one of the greatest female voices that I&amp;#8217;ve ever heard.
Beautiful Death by Bella Morte
This is still one of the best albums I&amp;#8217;ve heard in the past 10 years or so.
Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys by My Chemical Romace</description>

      <title>ID3 Tag Parsing</title>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2009/03/25/id3-tag-parsing/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a project to read and update ID3 tags on my music collection. An ID3 tag is the meta data embedded in mp3 files that contains artist and other information. My initial goal is to batch update the &amp;#8220;genre&amp;#8221; field in my mp3 files. I&amp;#8217;ve written a simple .Net forms application to do this. I found a really good library created by Novell called TagLib Sharp. The library makes it super easy to read and write ID3 tags.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve written about music, so here I go. My latest purchase is the new Morrissey album, Years of Refusal. I really like it. I would even say it&amp;#8217;s one of his best solo albums to date. Sure, his voice has flattened out with age, but he makes up for it with his usual clever lyrics and well composed music from his band. This album is very rock n&amp;#8217; roll and has some catchy tunes.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;#8217;ve had enough of the Perfect Day (sun is bad), I&amp;#8217;ve migrated to the great indoors. There are at least 4 things I&amp;#8217;d like to be doing while indoors: listening to music, looking at photos, browsing the web, and watching baseball. As it turns out, I&amp;#8217;m doing all 4 at once! Check it out.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m generally disappointed with the state of the World Wide Web these days. The WWW used to be a simple communications tool to share information on a globally connected network. I&amp;#8217;m not saying that it should have stayed that way, but I wish we had taken a more structured approach to innovation. I&amp;#8217;ve written about this before, so I won&amp;#8217;t go into it again. My point for today is that Last.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using Vagalume, a last.fm player, on my internet tablet. This might be one of the best and most useful pieces of software that I&amp;#8217;ve ever used. I particularly like the neighborhood radio feature, which plays songs from last.fm users that have similar tastes to mine. It&amp;#8217;s like having a portable radio that only plays stuff that I like.</description>

      <title>Minor Threat Sauce</title>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2007/12/23/minor-threat-sauce/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve just discovered a hot sauce named after one of my favorite 80s straight edge punk bands, Minor Threat. Pitchfork says it&amp;#8217;s so. It sounds delicious!
 Made from a rare, mild breed of habaneros grown specifically for us, Minor Threat draws its inspiration from the legendary West Indies&amp;#8217; mustard- and mango-based habanero sauces, only it mysteriously priviledges the pepper&amp;#8217;s fruitiness over its notoriously overwhelming heat.

      <description>This is one of my favorite new Morrissey songs. It is fitting that part of my dad&amp;#8217;s family are Irish immigrants living in England.

      <title>Morrissey vs. NME</title>

      <guid>http://noone.dev/2007/11/28/morrissey-vs-nme/</guid>
      <description>In the newest issue of NME (a British magazine about new music), there is a cover story on Morrissey. Morrissey and NME have always been at odds, but it has generally been tame. This time, however, rather than just publishing the Morrissey interview as it was done, NME decided to add commentary that totally trashes the man. I&amp;#8217;ve not read the article, titled &amp;#8220;Has the World Changed, or Has He Changed?</description>

      <description>Time for another song&amp;#8230; this one is by Therion. Therion is a Swedish gothic metal band. It&amp;#8217;s to my liking, but maybe not yours. Try it.

      <description>If you look at my Music page, you&amp;#8217;ll see that I&amp;#8217;ve added an &amp;#8220;album quilt&amp;#8221; from my last.fm account. It shows a collage of all the albums that I listen to most frequently. I think this is way cool, but you may not. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with last.fm, here&amp;#8217;s how it works: any time I listen to music, the song information is transmitted to my last.fm account. This way, I can get music recommendations based on what I listen to, I can have my own web radio station, I can show people what I listen to, etc.</description>

      <description>The Old: an amazing cover of the Queen song &amp;#8220;Stone Cold Crazy&amp;#8221; by Metallica. This is, of course, when Metallica was still a metal band.

      <description>Today I offer up three fine punk songs. These are three well known artists, so I won&amp;#8217;t go into a description of each. Use google if you really need to know more about them.

      <description>Alison Krauss will be at Macmenamins Edgefield on July 5, and we got great seats: 8 rows back in the center. I saw her once in San Francisco, but it was a huge outdoor concert under the Golden Gate bridge and I didn&amp;#8217;t hear much. This concert at the Edgefield will be more intimate and we&amp;#8217;ll be much closer.

      <description>Dag Nasty was my favorite punk band. They had a mostly positive message and lots of energy. I&amp;#8217;m not sure exactly what this song is about&amp;#8230; values and confidence?
&amp;#8220;fear of failure; fear of reprimand; two big problems I&amp;#8217;ve never had; I never doubted what I had inside&amp;#8230; what I have inside&amp;#8221;

      <description>A classic straight edge song from one of my favorite 80s punk bands, Uniform Choice. They weren&amp;#8217;t hugely popular, but I really like their anger and passion. This song is about how foolish and conformist it is to do drugs and get drunk.

      <description>Morrissey has announced his U.S. tour dates, and Portland is not on the list! He&amp;#8217;s not even stopping in Oregon. There are cities on the list that I&amp;#8217;ve never even heard of &amp;#8211; but no Portland. His last show here was a huge success, and I know he has a loyal following here. My only theory is that Morrissey is trying to avoid Johnny Marr, who is currently calling Portland home.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m debating whether or not to attend this year&amp;#8217;s Convergence, which is here in Portland.
 Convergence is an annual gothic-industrial festival, now in its 13th year. It is a chance for many goths and others who normally only meet on the Internet to come together in real life. Convergence is held in North America, in a different location each year voted on by previous attendees.
 Once a goth, always a goth, eh?</description>

      <description>This is a song that I wrote years ago. I now have a real keyboard, so I&amp;#8217;m hoping to become inspired soon to really learn how to play and write real music. For now this is all I have to offer.
