      <title>Rockets at Trailblazers</title>

      <description>On December 5th, we attended the Houston Rockets @ Portland Trailblazers game. We sat way up in the 300 section, but we had mid-court aisle seats which turned out to be quite nice. Portland won the game – and they have won all 3 games we’ve been to (against tough opponents). I think we bring good luck… for wins. Unfortunately, we were witness to the season ending injury of Greg Oden.</description>

      <description>Spring training is here for Major League Baseball. I’m not sure what to think about this season. Things aren’t looking bright for my favorite team, the Houston Astros. They are projected to be the worst team in baseball in 2009. Based on last year’s performance and our current roster, that projection could be accurate. Maybe I should follow the more geographically appropriate Mariners, but their season isn’t looking much better. Nor is Bren’s former home team, the Royals.</description>

As it turns out, however, I have little interest in this year’s Superbowl. I’m rooting for the Cardinals because they are the underdog. I was also just made aware that 3 teams share the record for the most championships, and the Steelers are one of those. The Cowboys are another, so I’d hate to see the Steelers pull ahead in that statistic.</description>

      <description>Someone of mild importance has finally given Lance Berkman a shout out for his insane month of May.
 For six glorious days, Lance Berkman was the best hitter anyone has ever seen. This will go down as one of the best weeks anyone has ever had in the history of the game…

      <title>Worst Pitcher in Baseball</title>

      <description>One of my regular reads is FanGraphs, which is a site about baseball players and statistics. I’ve been questioning the Astros’ decision to keep Brandon Backe for a while, and FanGraphs backs up my opinion in an article published today.
 Brandon Backe just may be the worst pitcher in baseball consistently given start after start… Why this man still gets paid to pitch in the major leagues befuddles me.</description>

      <title>Ike Messes Things Up</title>

      <description>My family in Texas recently sat through yet another hurricane. This time it was Ike, and it was a direct hit to Galveston and Houston. Luckily, my Houston (Katy) peeps went unscathed and those in Nederland/Port Neches had only minor damage to their houses. They were lucky because if the storm surge had been much higher, they would have had flood damage in addition to the wind damage.
On a related note, the streaking Astros were forced to play two “home” games against the Cubs just 90 miles from Chicago in Milwaukee.</description>

      <description>Being a web developer and active browser of the web for many years now, I see a lot of wasted web space (including this web site). I would venture to say that 90% of web sites out there are useless and/or uninteresting, or just a rehash of other web sites that are slightly more interesting.
And then there’s Batting Stance Guy, which is the best use of the web that I’ve seen lately.</description>

      <title>Portland Beavers</title>

      <description>We just got back from watching the Round Rock Express vs. the Portland Beavers. It was a good game! It was tied in the bottom of the 9th, and one of the Beavers hit a home run (almost) and the Express center fielder made an amazing catch over the wall to save the game. Then Reggie Abercombie hit a 3 run homer for the Express in the 11th and Fernando Nieve saved the game in the bottom of the 11th.</description>

      <description>Since my favorite MLB baseball team is doing so badly this year, I’ve started to lose interest in watching professional baseball. It’s not fun to watch your team lose. As a result, I’ve brainstormed some ideas to make the game better.
The season is too long! 162 regular season games per team is just too much. Sure, it makes for better statistics, but modern man/woman doesn’t have the attention span for it anymore.</description>

      <description>As soon as this becomes available, I’m going to buy it and get into shape. Apparently, you will be able to hula hoop, do yoga, do push ups, play soccer, and a bunch of other stuff – right in your own living room. You can’t beat that.</description>

      <title>What&amp;#8217;s Wrong with the Astros?</title>

      <description>I knew the Houston Astros would be a mediocre team this year, however I wasn’t prepared to see them lose 7 games in a row. It’s too early in the season to give up on them, but Berkman and Lee (and pretty much everyone else) need to kick it up a notch or two.</description>

      <description>It’s time again for March Madness (NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament). I’m usually neutral about who wins, but this year I’ve got 3 teams on my radar: Oregon, Texas, and Texas A�M. I’m not counting on any of those teams to win the whole thing, but it’s fun to root for them. I’m watching the Winthrop vs. Oregon game as I type…</description>
