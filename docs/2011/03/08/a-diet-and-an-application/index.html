    <p>I’ve started on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paleo Diet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which, of course, means I have to create a software application to go along with it.</p>
<p>I decided this was a good time to give <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MVC3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MongoDB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a test drive.  After diving in, I realized that I could benefit from some dependency injection via MVC3’s DependencyResolver.  I’ve been wanting to learn <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Autofac<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so I threw that in as the container.  This was sweet, as it injected my repository implementations into my controllers with very little setup.</p>
<p>At this point, I’ve learned all about the Razor view engine, DI with Autofac and DependencyResolver, MongoDB with the NoRM driver, jQuery, jQuery-ui, and some other MVC3 goodness.</p>
<p>For various reasons, including the fact that my web hosting provider is a Linux/non-ASP.NET provider, I ported the whole thing to Rails/MySql.  I’m glad I went through the MVC3 process, because I learned a lot, but in the end, Rails is just simpler.  As for MongoDB, and NoSQL in general, I think it’s best served as an edge case storage medium for fast read operations.  Data is relational.</p>
<p>Alas, here is a screenshot of the recipe database.  I’ll be adding lots of features, including menus and weight management.  You can’t see it here, but it has a cool tag cloud feature and theme switching.</p>
