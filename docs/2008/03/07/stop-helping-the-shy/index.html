<hr />
<div class="post-content">
    <p>Why is it that everyone is so motivated to help out shy people? I can guarantee you that if you aren&#8217;t severely shy, then you have no idea what it&#8217;s like. I came across this article today: <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/the-shy-persons-guide-to-talking-to-strangers/">The Shy Person’s Guide to Talking to Strangers</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, first of all, I barely talk to my friends, family, or the person I&#8217;m going to marry, so why would I seek out lessons on talking to strangers? Oh, there are beneficial relationships that can be formed, according to the article. Allow me to debunk them.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Business contacts&#8221;</em>: being a shy person, I chose a profession that doesn&#8217;t require making business contacts. Any sensible introvert would do the same. Intelligence and hard work go a long way on their own.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Friendships&#8221;</em>: believe it or not, but most people don&#8217;t mind being friends with a shy person. I&#8217;ve had plenty of friends in my lifetime, all without learning to talk to strangers. I would dare say that people who frequently talk to strangers wouldn&#8217;t make good friends anyway. Analyze that.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Mentors and teachers&#8221;</em>: I don&#8217;t know what the author means by this, but I don&#8217;t need them and I don&#8217;t want to be them either.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Romantic relationships&#8221;</em>: see my comment about friendships. The same applies to romantic relationships.</p>

<p>The author finishes up the article with:</p>

<p>&#8220;That’s really all there is to it. Good luck and don’t get discouraged. You have nothing to lose but your shyness!&#8221;</p>

<p>Good grief! Why not cut off my arms while I&#8217;m at it? Please stop trying to break us out of our &#8220;shells.&#8221; We are doing fine.</p>
