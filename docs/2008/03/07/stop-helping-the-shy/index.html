    <p>Why is it that everyone is so motivated to help out shy people? I can guarantee you that if you aren’t severely shy, then you have no idea what it’s like. I came across this article today: <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/the-shy-persons-guide-to-talking-to-strangers/">The Shy Person’s Guide to Talking to Strangers</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, I barely talk to my friends, family, or the person I’m going to marry, so why would I seek out lessons on talking to strangers? Oh, there are beneficial relationships that can be formed, according to the article. Allow me to debunk them.</p>
<p><em>“Business contacts”</em>: being a shy person, I chose a profession that doesn’t require making business contacts. Any sensible introvert would do the same. Intelligence and hard work go a long way on their own.</p>
<p><em>“Friendships”</em>: believe it or not, but most people don’t mind being friends with a shy person. I’ve had plenty of friends in my lifetime, all without learning to talk to strangers. I would dare say that people who frequently talk to strangers wouldn’t make good friends anyway. Analyze that.</p>
<p><em>“Mentors and teachers”</em>: I don’t know what the author means by this, but I don’t need them and I don’t want to be them either.</p>
<p><em>“Romantic relationships”</em>: see my comment about friendships. The same applies to romantic relationships.</p>
<p>The author finishes up the article with:</p>
<p>“That’s really all there is to it. Good luck and don’t get discouraged. You have nothing to lose but your shyness!”</p>
<p>Good grief! Why not cut off my arms while I’m at it? Please stop trying to break us out of our “shells.” We are doing fine.</p>
