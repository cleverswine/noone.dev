    <p>We got an exciting call a few days ago. We were told that we had won an all expense paid vacation/honeymoon package to an all inclusive resort in the Bahamas. Our name was entered at the Bridal Show, so we were pretty sure that it was a legitimate prize. The only catch was that we had to sit through a 90 minute presentation about fancy cookware. We went to the presentation last night at the Hayden Island Holiday Inn Express. To their credit, the cookware was actually quite nice (<a href="http://www.simplicitygourmet.com/">Simplicity Gourmet</a>). We resisted the urge to spend thousands of dollars on nice pots and pans, and left with our free vacation package. The vacation package isn’t so nice. It only covers 2 nights at the resort, and does not cover airfare. In addition, we would have to pay $200 ($50/person/night) up front for gratuity and taxes. I wouldn’t exactly say it’s a scam, even though we <em>were</em> mislead by the phone call. We’re not going to take the trip, as I’d rather pay a little more and go somewhere that we really want to go to.</p>
<p>As I was typing this, I did a quick search and found this thread on Brides.com…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brides.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=39891%EF%BF%BDtstart=0">Beware of Free Vacation From Simplicity Gourmet</a></p>
<p>If you’re wondering why I didn’t do that search before we accepted the vacation, it’s because we were not told on the phone who was doing the presentation and giving away the vacation packages.</p>
