<div class="post-content">
    <p>Today, I&#8217;ve come across a handful of websites which are exciting enough to me that they should be shared (with all 2 people that read my web site&#8230;).</p>

<p><a href="http://kitblog.com/2007/12/woody_allens_typography.html">Woody Allen&#8217;s typography</a></p>

<p>An article about another one of my favorite people, combined with the nerdiness of font analysis. It had never occurred to me that Woody uses the same font, Windsor-EF Elongated, for all of his film titles.</p>

<p><a href="http://zenhabits.net/2008/01/30-things-to-do-to-keep-from-getting-bored-out-of-your-skull-at-work/">30 Things to Do to Keep From Getting Bored Out of Your Skull at Work</a></p>

<p>Not that I would ever admit to being bored at work, but if by some miraculous miracle I did become bored, this could be a handy list of things to keep myself occupied.</p>

<p><a href="http://forevergeek.com/movies/star_trek_reboot_to_blast_off_this_year.php">Star Trek reboot to blast off this year</a></p>

<p>If there’s one movie that has the geeks all excited, it’s the Star Trek re-boot being helmed by JJ Abrams.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22934998/">Texas town forever twinned with Columbia</a></p>

<p>Ah, good ol&#8217; Nacogdoches. It&#8217;s not far from my hometown. One of my best friends, Kory B., got married settled down there. The bachelor party was interesting&#8230; think confederate flags, beer, and Willie Nelson.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.plunderingdesire.com/">The Smiths File Online</a></p>

<p>A new web site about the greatest band ever! The Smiths File Online is a thorough summary of the extensive coverage the band received in the music press from 1983-1987.</p>
