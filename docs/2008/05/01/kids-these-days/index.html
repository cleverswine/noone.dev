    <p><a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2008/05/centennial_high_drops_its_ban.html">Centennial High School has dropped its ban on eyebrow shaving</a>&#8230; that&#8217;s right, the kids are shaving their eyebrows. I guess there&#8217;s a trend in which kids shave designs into their brows. Unfortunately, a well known East Multnomah County gang does the same, which caused a bit of confusion and concern in this particular high school. I remember back when I was in school. It was the eighties, and the more over the top you could be, the better. My high school banned things like mohawks and certain colors of hair. I thought it was silly at the time and I still do. I think blue hair in high school would have made me a better person.</p>
