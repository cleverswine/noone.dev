    <p>I’m off to Texas tomorrow morning to visit family and see my new niece. I regularly keep up with Texas news, but I casually read it and move on. Today I came across an unusual story… well, unusual to those of us in the North. A man in Brazoria was routinely pulled over for making an illegal u-turn. The police found a 6 foot alligator and a water moccasin in his car, both alive. The snake had already bitten the man, but that didn’t keep him from driving along as if all was normal. And there’s more…<a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/5703545.html">Read the full story here</a>. The funniest part is the comment by the Brazoria Chief of Police, who says, “Just a typical day in Brazoria.”</p>
