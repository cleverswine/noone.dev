<hr />
<div class="post-content">
    <p>I&#8217;m generally disappointed with the state of the World Wide Web these days. The WWW used to be a simple communications tool to share information on a globally connected network. I&#8217;m not saying that it should have stayed that way, but I wish we had taken a more structured approach to innovation. I&#8217;ve written about this before, so I won&#8217;t go into it again. My point for today is that <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> has done things right. It&#8217;s the only modern web service that I use regularly, and it does exactly what it needs to do &#8211; nothing more and nothing less. I am sitting at work right now listening to &#8220;recommended&#8221; music, a lot of which I&#8217;ve never heard before. I have to say, there is a lot of good music out there, from the 50s to modern day. I have been &#8220;bookmarking&#8221; things that I like so I can look into purchasing them after a little more listening (Last.fm is not a free music download service).</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re interested in music and have the time to listen to it, I&#8217;d suggest looking into Last.fm. It&#8217;s free. I&#8217;m listening to the Dixie Chicks right now. I never even thought to give them the time of day, but I like what I hear.</p>
