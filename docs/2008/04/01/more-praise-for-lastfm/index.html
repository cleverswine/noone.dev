<h3><a href="/2008/04/01/more-praise-for-lastfm/">More Praise for Last.fm</a></h3>
<sub>April 1, 2008</sub>
<hr />
<div>
    <p>I’m generally disappointed with the state of the World Wide Web these days. The WWW used to be a simple communications tool to share information on a globally connected network. I’m not saying that it should have stayed that way, but I wish we had taken a more structured approach to innovation. I’ve written about this before, so I won’t go into it again. My point for today is that <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> has done things right. It’s the only modern web service that I use regularly, and it does exactly what it needs to do – nothing more and nothing less. I am sitting at work right now listening to “recommended” music, a lot of which I’ve never heard before. I have to say, there is a lot of good music out there, from the 50s to modern day. I have been “bookmarking” things that I like so I can look into purchasing them after a little more listening (Last.fm is not a free music download service).</p>
<p>So, if you’re interested in music and have the time to listen to it, I’d suggest looking into Last.fm. It’s free. I’m listening to the Dixie Chicks right now. I never even thought to give them the time of day, but I like what I hear.</p>
