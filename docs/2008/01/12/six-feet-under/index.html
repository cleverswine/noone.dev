    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We just finished watching the <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/">Six Feet Under</a> complete series box set. What a great show that was! I was a little unsure about the ending, but now that I’ve had time to absorb it, I think it’s brilliant. For those who don’t know, the show was an HBO series about a family that runs and lives in a funeral home. The character development is wonderful, and the shooting style is similar to that of American Beauty (same writer/director). There is a lot of death in the show, but it achieves it’s goal of making us face death and realize that it’s a part of life.</p>
