    <p>We were seriously considering the Abernathy Center after our visit today. But, we had also scheduled an appointment at the Viewpoint Inn, located in the Columbia River Gorge, near the Vista House. As we wound our way up the road, the rain changed into snow. As many of you know, I get very excited about snow. I jokingly quipped to Bren that this was a sign that we had found our wedding site. Well, within a few minutes of touring the Inn, we were both awestruck. The place is amazing! It’s a reflection of both our tastes. After touring The Viewpoint Inn, the Abernathy Center was clearly the wrong choice for our wedding. We booked it immediately. So, our wedding date is set – Sunday, September 7th. That’s 09/07/08. Be there or be square. I will be updating the wedding website with googles of information in the next day or two. We are excited!</p>
