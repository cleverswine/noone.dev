    <p><em>Location</em></p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be looking at two potential wedding locations this weekend. Our preference is for an outdoor ceremony, so that&#8217;s where we are starting. First, we&#8217;ll be looking at the <a href="http://www.abernethycenter.com/">Abernathy Center</a> in Oregon City. We like the photos we&#8217;ve seen. There are lots of gardens and gazebos and we would have the reception outdoors under a large tent. Second, we&#8217;ll be looking at <a href="http://www.theviewpointinn.com/">Viewpoint Inn</a> in Corbett. This place is really nice and upscale, and has a fabulous view. I feel pretty good about both of these places. It may be hard to choose in the long run.</p>

<p><em>Music</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and re-listening to music for the past couple of weeks, trying to decide what to play at our reception. This task has not been easy, as most of what I like would not be appropriate for a wedding reception. Sure, it&#8217;s <em>my</em> wedding, etc., but really, my choices would not sit well with a civilized group of people. I&#8217;m torn. Should I just scrap the idea of playing my favorites and put on classical music? Or should I just pick my favorites that are somewhat acceptable to the masses? It&#8217;s not in my nature to appeal to the masses&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Web Site</em></p>

<p>Some of you have seen the web site and participated in the interactive pages. I have been getting positive feedback so far. I wonder if anyone realizes that I totally stole the layout and graphics from someone else&#8217;s web site? As a reminder, I am <em>not</em> a web designer, I am a programmer. Therefore, I had no choice but to steal. Once we have selected a date for the wedding, I will update all of the location and date specific pages and announce the URL to everyone we know.</p>
