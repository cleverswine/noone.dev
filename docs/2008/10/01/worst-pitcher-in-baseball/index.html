    <p>One of my regular reads is <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/">FanGraphs</a>, which is a site about baseball players and statistics. I’ve been questioning the Astros’ decision to keep Brandon Backe for a while, and FanGraphs backs up my opinion in an <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/the-bottom-five/">article published today</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brandon Backe just may be the worst pitcher in baseball consistently given start after start… Why this man still gets paid to pitch in the major leagues befuddles me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the MLB playoffs are starting and I have no team to cheer for. I don’t care for any of the NL teams, and I’m not familiar with any of the AL teams. As usual, I’d prefer to see the NL win the World Series. I’d probably lean towards the Brewers (strong lineup) or the Phillies (Brad Lidge). As for the AL, maybe the Devil Rays since they had such a turnaround season. For the most part though, I don’t care who wins.</p>
