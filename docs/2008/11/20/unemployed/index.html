    <p>The awful economy has finally hit home. Razorfish was forced to lay off quite a few people to deal with hard times, and I was one of those people. Fortunately, they gave me a good severance package and then there’s unemployment pay if it comes to that.

Maybe I’d mix in some Ruby, Rails, Perl, PHP, database, etc. It all depends on how long I’m idle.</p>
