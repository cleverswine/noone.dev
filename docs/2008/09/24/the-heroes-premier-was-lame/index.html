<div class="content">
    <p>We watched the season premiere of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/">Heroes</a> last night. We were warned by various sources that it would be bad, and they were not wrong. The story line seems desperate so far, as if the writers are more concerned about the hype than they are quality. The characters seem more shallow, and the dialog was just horrible (which can work in shows like “Buffy”, where dry humor and spoof are part of the game). “Are you going to eat my brain?” Some of the special effects were ripped straight from “Saw” and they so didn’t work in the context of Matt being lost in the desert. The whole episode was cheesy and infuriating, and was made 100 times worse by the lame one hour countdown show that preceded it. Alas, we’ll continue to watch, as will most people, and the Heroes team knows that. It can only get better.</p>
