    <p>Scott Hanselman has been trumpeting Windows Live Writer for some time now.  I’ve been hesitant to try it out because I’m a control freak and I was convinced that Live Writer wouldn’t do things correctly.  Well, he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogged about it again today<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so I’m giving it a try (with this post).  It was the comments on his post that swayed me.</p>
<p>Live Writer has improved quite a bit since last time I tried it.  It actually pulled down my WordPress theme in order to provide a themed preview, which isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough to get an idea.  Adding categories and tags is really simple, with type-ahead suggestions from previous posts.  It looks like it has some powerful picture, video and map embedding tools, which I will try eventually.</p>
<p>The thing I’m most curious about is embedding code snippets.  It looks like all of the syntax highlighting plugins are 2+ years old.  Update: I tried a couple of them and they both resulted in an awful looking table.</p>
